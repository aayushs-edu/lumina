United States,"I vividly remember a childhood where subtle inequalities were so normalized that I never questioned themuntil I grew older. In my early years at school in the United States, I was always expected to be quiet, polite, and ladylike. I watched as boys were encouraged to be outspoken and adventurous, while I was gently reminded to act with restraint. Over time, I realized that these expectations werent about inherent differences but about societys strict gender roles. This narrative describes the gradual awakening to the unfair assumptions that shaped my education, friendships, and self?image, and the determination I eventually found to challenge these stereotypes.","['Cultural', 'Education']",4,"I was always expected to be quiet,"
United States,"Throughout my life, I encountered countless moments where I felt undervalued simply because I was a woman. In the workplace and in daily interactions, I noticed a constant bias: decisions were made for me without my input, and my opinions were often overlooked. I struggled with the frustration of being judged by my appearance rather than my abilities. This narrative recounts those experiences in detail, explaining how each incident chipped away at my confidence while also lighting a fire within me to fight for equality. Its a story of resilience, self?awareness, and the ongoing battle against a system that often assumes women are less capable.","['Workplace', 'Identity']",2,I struggled with the frustration of being
India,"I was born in a small town in India, where the arrival of a daughter was not celebrated as much as that of a son. My grandparents and many elders openly wished for a boy, and my opportunities were limited by strict social norms. Despite the lack of support, I fought to pursue education and eventually started my own venture. Every setback fueled my determination to prove that I was as capable as any man.

Bangladesh,"Fleeing the brutality of Myanmar in 2017, I found myself in the vast Rohingya refugee camps of Bangladesh. As a transgender woman, my struggles were compounded by deep-rooted discrimination and rejectioneven within my own community. Despite these challenges, I built a small beauty salon in the camp that became a beacon of hope. Every day, I courageously face attacks and isolation, yet I continue to train other transgender women in beautician skills so that we can all reclaim our dignity. My story is one of perseverance in the face of unimaginable adversity, where every act of self-affirmation is a rebellion against a system that would deny my right to exist.","['Identity', 'Public Space']",2,"I courageously face attacks and isolation, yet"
United States,"I still recall high school math class when my teacher blatantly refused to answer questions from the girls, declaring we wouldnt need math after we marry and get pregnant. His words were laced with condescension, and though I was only a student then, his assumptions made me feel invisible and unworthy. Over time, this experience became a defining moment in my understanding of gender bias. It wasnt just about one math classit was a microcosm of a system that expected us to fit a narrow role. My narrative is a reminder that when voices are silenced in class, a whole generation is deprived of the chance to dream beyond traditional boundaries.","['Education', 'Identity']",4,"only a student then, his assumptions made"
United States,"During my undergraduate studies, I met with my major advisor to discuss grad school plans. To my shock, he told me that pursuing archaeology wasnt advisable for a womanit was too dangerous. His words forced me to redirect my academic path, stifling my passion for a field I loved. The disappointment was profound; not only was I discouraged from following my dream, but I also internalized the notion that certain careers were off limits simply because of my gender. This narrative recounts that pivotal moment of discouragement, the internal struggle to reclaim my ambition, and the eventual realization that I must forge my own path regardless of outdated stereotypes.","['Identity', 'Education']",4,eventual realization that I must forge
United States,"On the very first day of my high school physics class, my teachers casual remark still echoes in my mind. As I began answering a question, he abruptly cut me off to instruct me to use my science words. It was as if my voice and intellect were secondary simply because I was a girl. This incident, minor though it might have seemed, planted a seed of doubt about my abilities in a field dominated by boys. Over the years, Ive had to work doubly hard to assert my place in science. This story is a testament to the quiet discrimination that undermines confidence and how I learned to overcome those early, demeaning remarks.","['Education', 'Identity']",4,I was a girl
United States,"Whenever I mentioned my job in finance, people automatically assumed my boss must be a man. Their assumptions left me feeling isolated and frustrated.

United States,"In high school, I ran for a leadership position in our band, the only girl among many boys. Despite pouring my heart into every rehearsal and event, I was constantly overlooked. When I finally won a co-presidency, the credit was stolen by a male peer who contributed little. This experience wasnt just about band leadership; it was a harsh lesson in how society often undervalues womens contributions.

United States,"I vividly remember the moment in primary school when teachers would always call on the big, strong boys to carry chairs. Watching them, I realized that societys expectations werent about actual physical strength but about assigning roles based solely on gender. I knew deep down that I could easily carry twice the load they could, yet I was never given a chance. This realization was both empowering and heartbreakingit exposed how gender stereotypes limit opportunities before we even have a chance to prove ourselves. That day sparked a quiet rebellion in me, a determination to challenge the status quo and demonstrate that strength isnt confined to one gender.","['Education', 'Cultural']",4,I was never given a chance
United States,"In my early career, I encountered a moment that left a lasting impact. One day, my male supervisor, instead of praising my work, told me I should wear makeup to work to make everybody happier. His comment was not only patronizing but also a stark reminder that women were expected to conform to superficial standards at the expense of their professionalism. I felt demeaned, as if my skills were secondary to my appearance. This narrative details that painful experience and my slow journey toward asserting that my value in the workplace comes from my abilities and not how I choose to present myself.

Tired of feeling boxed in by expectations, I set out to redefine what it meant to be a woman in todays world. My journey was one of both internal and external battlesovercoming prejudices at work, in social circles, and even within myself. I learned that gender equality isnt about erasing differences; its about ensuring that those differences never become a barrier to opportunity.

When my school district mandated policies that forced teachers to hide childrens gender transitions and use preferred pronouns, I refused to comply.

South Korea,"I was born and raised in a conservative corner of South Korea, where traditional gender roles were rigidly enforced. As a young girl, I felt the weight of expectations that dictated how I should act, dress, and even think. The pressure was immense: to be demure, to prioritize others needs, and to conform to a narrow definition of femininity. Over time, I began to question these norms and found solace in a burgeoning feminist movement that rejected a world defined solely by male expectations.

The head of one of the prestigious schools at the university came over to ask some questions. Any time I would answer one, he would turn and ask the exact same question to my partner.

I wasn't good at it because I was a woman; I was good at it because I had studied cake decorating alongside my mother when I was growing up because she decorated cakes for 15+ years. I also cared about the quality of the cakes I put out. My boss especially did not care. I had to take a week off work suddenly due to medical issues, so my boss was stuck making the cakes.

From a young age, I was told to dress modestly and avoid being alone with men because boys will be boys. When it happened, I felt ashamed and convinced that no one would believe me if I spoke up.

India,"While nature has made men and women physically different, gender inequality at an insane level has been encouraged by the society. I live in India. Here, how unfortunate it is to be female will be declared to you the moment you are able to understand things.

I may have been 6 or 7 when I first witnessed that my elder brothers needs were more important not because the need was really important but because he was a boy. And being a boy in India will keep you closer to all kinds of honours. Being a boy in India will also help you escape from sins you commit.

Wondering why? The structure and working of the Indian society is such that the males will oppress you if you are a female but the females too will oppress you. Without realizing how naturally we have adopted gender inequalities, we keep oppressing the females, based on gender and sex.

My story will reveal to you the most mundane thing. I perform the household chores and work at office too. My salary is good. I contribute 80% of my salary at home. My brother (7 years elder to me) does not work at all, neither at home nor at office. Yet he enjoys a higher say in everything.

Sadly, at my place, it is believed that girls should eat less because they learn to adjust from the beginning. Boys are fed more than necessary. What bothers me a lot is that I care more for my parents but I never felt them reciprocate the same to me.

United States,"The point made in another answer about hiring women because they work harder for less money hit home. I had a boss early in my career (late 1960s) who said almost exactly that to the three of us women (computer programmers, back when these were rare creatures) who worked for him. I hire women because theyll work twice as hard for half the money. I took that as a cue to ask for a greater increase in pay the next time we got a pay raise, and was told: What do you want more money for? Your husband makes good money.

My high school advised me to drop mathematics after intermediate algebra because you wont need it anyway. (I spent the last 13 years of my working life as an academic in a Faculty of Mathematics, though strictly speaking Im a computer scientist.)

I wanted to study at Cal Tech. They did not accept female undergraduates.

And at the University of California (Berkeley), I was told by my academic adviser that I need not take 16 units per semester, 12 would do, as: Anyway, youre only here to find a husband and youll be leaving as soon as you do, so whats your rush? I was also told by the same adviser that Youre taking up the place of some poor guy whos now sitting getting shot at out in Vietnam. You dont belong here.

When I applied to UCLA to study for a masters degree, I was turned down on the grounds: We dont accept married women, because they get pregnant and never finish their degrees. If youre still around after youve done a masters elsewhere, come back and we might consider you for a PhD.

United States,"Talking of gender inequality, like most women, I face it on a daily basis, pretty much everywhere in India.

In the immediate family:

My father wanted a boy and though he accepted me, I know he still wished for a boy. He would occasionally catch himself saying, If I had a boy, I could have blah, blag etc.

In preschool:

Even when as young as 4 years, I remember crying myself to sleep one night because a nanny at my school decided that 4 years was a great time to tell me that I would one day have to leave my parents and go to somebody else's house when I got married. This was her way trying correct my irresponsible behavior and remainding me that I was a girl. On the other hand, boys who did stuff much more irresponsible by common standards, were lauded as cute, naughty, smart etc.

As a child in the extended family:

I was expected to help my mother in the kitchen from the time I remember while my male cousins got to play video games the whole day. Of course, I was given a few opportunities to play, where they would act like superior games whose hard earned points were lost everytime I made a mistake. Funny thing is, this was often attributed to girls being bad at gaming"" whereas in reality it was the obvious reflection of the amount of time I had put in the kitchen while they played.

Whenever any even slightly mechanical stuff was explained to us as kids, I got sidelined, coz, hey, girls are too dumb to understand, right? This, again, was funny, considering that I was the only kid who could fix toy cars, small torches etc. in the group.

Anyways, when I was 7 years old, I was fortunate enough to get a chance to study abroad and that was my only break from gender discrimination.

At church:

I am Christian and enrolled for Sunday school in my church, and one day a teacher called me aside to tell me that the male teachers told her to talk to me coz my dress was too short"". Funny thing is I, a 13 year old, was wearing a frock with a three-fourth pants underneath it. At most, what was revealed of my legs would be, at most, 3 inches from my foot. Needless to say, I was offended. I lost the respect I had for the male teachers there. I knew they shouldn't be looking at my legs.

As a teen in the extended family:

I was expected to spent my whole day in the kitchen to get a good girl"" tag. It was repetitive and tiring. Whenever I refused, I was told, One day you will get married! What will you do then??. I never heard anyone bother boys my age with this sort of crappy threats. They were lucky simply because of their gender.

At high school:

I joined a catholic school and learnt that girls would be sent back to hostel from class if their dress was worn to distract boys"". I learnt that in schools, distraction free environment for boys was more important than girls education. There were a lot of wierd rules like girls shouldn't laugh loudly since that would bring unwanted attention, girls shouldn't sit facing each other in the mess since then, half of them would be facing the boys on the other side and distract them"", girls shouldn't sit in the library since we all know girls go to library to trap boysyou name it. Girls were treated like they came from brothels. This was by far the worst case of sexism I've encountered.

At my Engineering college:

During my engineering studies, most of the sexism I encountered were limited to the labs and hostel rules, but it was much better than the experience at school. Once I designed a whole circuit as part of a group project but when we came to present it, the teaching assistant didn't let me speak a single word and totally ignored me. I was treated like a sidekick who didn't understand circuits, while the boys in my group got the credit for my work.

A (female!) calculus teacher who blatantly preferred the boys and ignored the girls in her class.
Girls were not allowed to take shop class in junior high school. I guess they were afraid the girls might menstruate on the band saw.
A manager who had a policy of hiring women because they would work harder for less money.
Female flight attendants who could be fired for getting married, getting pregnant, or turning 30. The airlines wanted them to be eye candy for the male passengers, and to create the impression that they were sexually available.
A university campus with so many rapes that it was necessary to create safety escorts for women walking around after dark.
Open discrimination against women by the US military and by NASA.
Banks that wont lend to single women because they assume that a womans income is not secure.
Female friends who have been groped and harassed on public transportation and other places.

India,"Do you know that most men in India are exempted from doing basic household chores like washing the plate in which they had food from? I went to my aunt's home where they have a girl and boy child. The girl child was asked to wash the plate after food while the men of the family left the plate on the table. Not only does this create problems to the future wife of unmarried men, it can create a cycle including the kids too. This is slowly changing among educsted men when both of them works.
The men of the family are not expected to cook. Many of them think cooking is a women's job hence it is embarrassing to help. This is greatly fuelled by mothers of such men who pamper the children expecting their daughter in law to do all the work. I know dozen men who do not get up from the sofa to help out. And you know what happens when the women is sick? The entire household suffer. The children cannot take lunch to schools. Cooking is an essential skill everyone should know. Do it even if you dont like it.
The men in the family eat first. This is not widely spread as the others. But I have always seen women distributing food for their family and when they sit down, they don't have anyone to do it for them.
Childcare. You don't know how much I envy the western world for their views on childcare. Here only the mom wakes up when the child is crying, mom teaches the children, mom make and pack food. Mom is expected to be motherly and give up her job. There is no such thing as going to your home for two days without a 3 year old child because the husband do not want full responsibility.
Drinking or smoking is taboo for women but ok for men. Although both of these habits are bad, if the men can have an occasional drink, why not women? Why are women expected to be perfect in this regard?
Men are not expected to be up by 7 AM to help out, but women are. Not only do women require more sleep, they need more rest because they take care of the household too. If a women is sleeping past 8, the women is irresponsible, but if it is a man, it is because he is tired. This is one problem I observed in my family and absolutely hate because I don't like getting up early on weekends.
A women is expected to be pure(virgin and no relationship) before marriage. Men are not expected to be so. This is slowly changing with the mindset change of new generation.
A women's family have to take care of wedding expenses. Dont get me started on dowry. Wedding is for both the sides. Both the families are attending. I dont understand why most grooms family do not offer to give half the expenses. The marriage ordeal is the main reason women are seen as burden in many families.
Education: A women need not study or pursue her dream because she might get married but men have more flexibility. Indian families mostly spend for their guy children's education more than girls. This is also slowly changing",['Domestic'],2,I know dozen men who do not
United States,"I work with many people from various African and Middle Eastern countries. Their perspectives of gender roles are quite different than mine. Most of them do not force their beliefs on me and other females, but enough of them do that its become a workplace issue.

Me and my female coworkers have been shamed numerous times by these crazies. On one occasion I was told to shut up and learn respect. My close colleague was told she shouldnt study IT because its a mans job. A Ukrainian colleague had to endure both sexist and racist remarks from one Pakistani guy who was a Putin fanboy. All of us have gotten harassed at least once. And the higher up the ladder you are, the more harassment you get. These men do not like working under women, (but theyve also proven to be incompetent for such positions anyways).

Reports of these sexist incidents usually get swept under the rug due to them not being considered urgent issues. Putin fanboy recently got terminated for it tho, so theres still some hope. Another good outcome is its brought the women at work closer together. Ive learned a lot about the world this past year lol.","['Workplace', 'Identity']",2,I was told to shut up and
Germany,"Japan is not treating women equal. We're stuck in the past here when it comes to many things (equal pay, how housework and care work is distributed). Women are expected to be pretty and thin and not too aggressive.

However: You are a foreigner. No one expects you to be the same as Japanese women (unless you are Asian, in which case things may be different). You get to bypass most of the bullshit.

You instead get to only experience the good sides of life as a woman here: There is basically no cat calling. I have never changed the side of the street because I saw a group of young men together. Sexual assault exists and is a problem, but I've never felt as safe in Berlin, Germany when growing up as I did in Tokyo. I've been out drinking late and went home on my own, without ever really worrying about my safety. Day to day I really prefer living here as a woman.","['Workplace', 'Public Space']",2,Day to day I really prefer living
Kenya,"Where I come from, police officers are some of the most highly respected people, and becoming one brought pride to my family. However, being a female police officer in Kenya can pose challenges. Kenyan culture is part of the African old patriarchal system where women are not placed in places of power. In most cases men will feel degraded if I arrest them. Sometimes they even use sexual advances, thinking thats what I need to get them off the hook. It is important that women are part of the police force because most people find women more understanding. Women have a unique way of policing that is generally based on communications.

I have been part of the Administration Police Headquarters for the last six years.

In my tenure as the Secretary of the Kenya Association of Women in Policing, I have gained an immense interest in cases relating to sexual or gender-based violence. I am currently running a network of middle and junior management-level police officers and we push for cases they are handling to reach successful prosecution.","['Workplace', 'Identity']",2,I am currently running a network of
Afghanistan,"Afghanistan - Farmers didnt think that I would be able to handle this business, because I am a woman and this is not a womans job.

When I started working to process and export saffron to international markets, the farmers and saffron producers didnt want to give me their saffron to process and export because they thought that as a woman, I was too weak to handle this business. With the help of my husband and male members of my family, I sat down with the saffron producers and I explained to them that I have good knowledge, some experience and the ability to run this business. I assured them that they would not suffer losses if they put their trust in me. After many discussions, a couple of saffron farmers agreed to work with me, to test whether I had the ability to handle this business.

Then, I had to convince women to work with me. In my village, women were not used to working outside the home. I talked to their husbands and other members of their families and explained to them the benefits of working outside the home. I told their husbands: your wives and daughters will earn money to boost the family income. And the place where your women would work are all full of women. After many, many conversations with each family, they agreed to work with me. Now most of them are businesswomen and they run their own companies.

Gaining visibility, however, brought with it death threats from the religious extremists because I was going out in the markets. Despite several challenges, I never gave up because I knew the only way to eliminate violence against women is to help women become economically independent and empowered. With this in mind, I worked hard and struggled to help women to learn, work and earn. And this worked.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",2,I worked hard and struggled to help
United States,"Mali - I was 6 years old when I was cut. But for me, the most traumatic experience was seeing what my older sister went through. She wasn't as lucky as me. She suffered terrible injuries and almost died. The scars will remain with us for life. Where we live, more than 80 per cent of girls go under the knife.

Some 20 years ago, I decided I wanted to become a leader and educator and devote my energy to combating gender-based violence. My first battle was to save my own girls. I have four daughters, aged between 19 and 27, and not one has been cut. It wasn't easy for my husband, but he listened to my arguments. My first-hand experience and other testimonies convinced him.

We have a duty to act and to ensure that every girl is able to live a dignified and fulfilled life. I love my job. I have no shame or fear. My role is to save lives and to protect people's dignity. I've saved thousands of lives by asking women and men to sign agreements and to take formal oaths. In doing so, they agree not to engage in female genital mutilation themselves, and not to stand back and allow it to happen to others. On average, I secure at least 100 new signatures each month. I've also managed to persuade two leading cutters in Kita, which has one of the highest rates of FGM in Mali, to stop performing female genital mutilation.",['Identity'],1,My first-hand experience and other testimonies convinced
United States,"Yes, I have experienced housing discrimination, twice, in Chicago in a university neighborhood of all places! It happened once in 2011 and again in 2013.

In 2011, I was a freshman looking to move off campus, and I found an apartment for 300$. Sweet, I thought! Super cheap when I was originally paying 700 in the residence halls. So I messaged the guy, and he asked me more about myself. I said I should mention that I'm gay. He replied back saying, I'm sorry, we can't allow gay men or women into our apartment, were orthodox Jews, I'm sorry, it's not you it's us. I thought, meh, no big deal, and I said good luck and found somewhere else to live. It wasn't a big deal at all.

The second time was when I was going to senior year, and I found another place again for 300 dollars. I made the arrangements in May to move in September. I met with the tenant who looked much older to me - she was an Argentinian woman who was going to medical school and was studying to take her USMLE step 3, the test first year medical residents take to become doctors in the US. She seemed nice. The apartment was super messy and dirty but I was like whatever, it's super cheap.

A week after moving in, she asked me if I wanted to have the samosas the previous tenant left behind, but she said I don't know if you want them, since I think they belonged to the girl who was a lesbian, and she might have diseases.

I was like oh shit. And so I told her, I don't know if you know, but I'm gay. She was like, really? I was like yeah. And then an awkward silence passed, and I was like, are you okay? She was like, no. I was like, do you want to talk about it? And she was like, no. And then I said, do you want me to leave? She was like, yes. And then that was it, I left to get some fresh air, and called my friend to tell her what happened, and then I looked for a new place on the school marketplace. I go online to find a new place, and I see she already put a listing for a new roommate.

I was shocked, I got into a fight with her and then my friend helped me move out. It was the worst moment of my life. When I moved out I wrote her an email about how ignorant she was, thinking you can get an STD just by living with someone. Especially since she was a doctor! I found out months later she was 75. People have told me why did I tell her I was gay, but I think, why not? It shouldn't be a big deal anyway, and it would have been worse if she found later.

Anyway, discrimination is real and all around us. There are other ways I've been advantaged by being a Chinese male, so I see both worlds. I can only imagine how difficult it is for other minorities to get cheap and affordable housing, and they can't even hide their race, as I can hide my sexual orientation.

So, there is this teacher at Aakash, let's call him Rahul sir (name changed). He isto put it easily, a hypocrite. It started as small comments, but it has gotten worse and it is still going on.

In our class, the boys sit on one side and the girls on the other. We are all more comfortable sitting this way. There are 4 to 5 boys who study physics really well, like almost a perfect score on the tests. In the same way, there are girls who study really well.

He is the kind of guy who demeans and discourages a girl if she scores less on the test but says nothing to a boy who probably has a 'valid reason to score bad.

He doesn't understand that some girls do housework and studying together and overall they have a tad bit more responsibilities. He is the kind of guy who just wants appreciation from the young, teen boys of our age. And he must be well around in his early 30s.

Nepals total population is about 30 million. Out of this more than fifty percent is Women. In Nepal, like other developing countries, the state of women is not satisfactory. Male dominated family system provides very little scope for the female to assert their identity. They are marginalized from economic and social opportunities due to illiteracy, poverty and conservative social taboos. The present status of women is said to be strong than the past but it is the same.32 women have been Members of Parliament after restoration of democracy but it is only limited up to the written forms but not so practically. The status of women is the same as it used to be in the past.Along with the passes of time different chamges has been made and in various sectors reservation seats no. for women have been extended .

My neighbor is a pretty woman who has been living near me for 5 years. Her mother in law tortures her for not giving a birth to a boy child. As she has already given birth to two girl child. So they warned her that if next time she does not give birth to a boy then she has to leave the home and her husband will marry another woman. So she in the fear of losing her husband was ready to give birth to another child but unfortunately she got miscarriage and she got admitted to the hospital. The family members in this situation rather than consoling the women they didnt cared about her and left her in the hospital. After few days the husband got married to another woman .They didnt allow her to enter the house and meet her daughters. Men can leave their wives for petty reasons such as if they fail to give birth to a male heir.

Socially and economically men are always considered as superior to women, breadwinner, head of the family and the care taker and this is major cause for the low participation of women in every sector. This is only one example from our society there are several such discriminations and crimes happening in our society for several reasons. Not only in Nepal but throughout the world females are being dominated by males. But this problem have been dwindled by big margins in other nations .

And It is time that Nepalese men understood the value of their women and respected them for what they are. After all their mothers were also born as girls.

Its all depends upon the thoughts? of people and tgis gender discrimination related to women is dwindling day by day .we can only find this discrimination by the people of our grandparents and parents generation but it is true fact the discrimination will be ZERO WHEN OUR GENERATION COME .

Actually we people of our generation are more conscious rather than our parents generation as they were probably not this smarter during same age of ours.

When I went to Hong Kong for business, everyone in our community acted like I had died, and my poor husband would fall apart without me, and rushed in to offer support. They congratulated him for keeping the kids alive. When a few months later, my husband went to Hong Kong for 10 days - and I ended up deathly ill while he was gone - I got NO offers of help until I demanded it, and then it was only grudging. I even had people telling me that maybe it was easier when he was gone.

My husband does all the cooking in our house. He gets massive amounts of praise for this, and I get told how lucky I am. When I cook (rarely), no one raises an eyebrow.

United States,"I was a few weeks into my role as an HR specialist. I cared a lot about people, and having done some HR work during university, I thought this was where I can add immediate value. I revamped onboarding, re-evaluated the work contracts, and had many ideas around performance management. I was excited.

We onboarded a new guy to the company. He was a suave-looking Argentinian Caucasian who had no China experience. My manager wanted to persuade him to work with us in HR, and he agreed. But one day, the companys Head of Sales, a brash Nordic man whose looks could easily double as a Bond villain, came by the HR corner and spotted the Argentinian guy.

He demanded, Why are you here? You should come work with me in Sales!

Argentinian guy protested, But it looks like theres some interesting work here, like setting performance review standards

Oh thats not important, you can do so much more in Sales! You can just throw that work to her. Head of Sales dismissively pointed at me and walked away.

In that moment I felt so insulted. His words and actions showed me that my work in HR was not important, and that a white male with no relevant experience was more valuable than me, an Asian female who spoke Chinese. It hurt me to my core.

I sat there dumbfounded for 5 min and had to excuse myself out of the office. I walked around the block and cried. I was angry at myself for crying, but I couldnt keep my cool.",['Workplace'],0,I felt so insulted
United States,"I was a few weeks into a new project. Staffed with exclusively Texas-based Caucasian males, I was already keenly aware I was the odd one out.

One day, I was working in the team room with two of the project leads. Theyve been at our consulting firm for many years, and randomly began reminiscing about old projects. They started laughing and referencing inside jokes that I didnt understand.

They mentioned things like, Remember when she did that? Oh my god, hahaha

A few min later, the main client, who was a Partner at our consulting firm before he joined the aviation company, dropped by. The two leads brought him into the reminiscing session, and even pulled up an old email on their laptop to show the client. They all started laughing hysterically, giving each other high fives.

Curious, I asked, Whats so funny?

In between laughs, one of them uttered, Oh, we cant share this in mixed company.

*Translation: We cant tell you because youre a woman

Three Caucasian men. One Asian girl. I was dampening their fun. What could they possibly be looking at during work hours that they cant share in mixed company? I wanted to yell at them, to tell them this was inappropriate and that it made me uncomfortable.

But I perpetuated my own stereotype. I played the obedient Asian girl and kept quiet. I let them continue laughing. I just sat across the table and worked in silence.

All these years later, I still remember these two moments vividly. Theyre vivid because I felt excluded and treated unfairly solely because I was a woman. I dont think any of these men intended to make me feel that way. They probably didnt even notice. But the impact was real, and the scar remains. These experiences tinged my morale at both companies.

For the well-intentioned men reading this, I hope you can try to understand how I felt and be mindful of how you treat the women in your professional and personal lives.

For my fellow women reading this, I hope that youll be braver than me. If something inappropriate or unfair happens to you, be vocal and call them out on it. Your perspectives are valid, and they deserve to be heard. If you dont even voice your concern, how will they know to change?

For everyone (including myself), lets be more thoughtful about how our behaviors might affect those different from us. This goes beyond just gender bias. Our comfort zone is easy, but we may alienate others and make them feel excluded or uncomfortable.

United States,"My name is Seila, I am 45 years old and work as a dominatrix. I have my own studio, I am self -employed. Due to the lockdowns, I had to close my studio temporarily and my daily structure was 
completely lost. The first lockdown was a shock for me. I noticed the psychological strain; I could no longer feel joy. In particular, the uncertainty about how long this  phase would 
last, how to cope financially and whether there is any support available, was getting to me. In the second lockdown, I tried to cope with this uncertainty by determining the closing time of my studio myself. It was still an emotional rollercoaster. Only in the last lockdown was I able to use the free time constructively, perhaps also because 3 weeks were manageable, it was clear that it is only going to be three weeks, so I could use it as a break. Financially, I was able to make ends meet because I had some savings to fall back on. At one point, home visits were allowed, so I visited an elderly customer once a week. That 
was great for me. I know that many of my colleagues have financial problems. Es pecially 
because we must register as new self -employed and insure ourselves. But this has a few 
weak points. For example, when brothels tax their women at a flat rate, they don't have 
a tax number. But they needed one now to get the hardship fund. In addit ion, they 
needed an Austrian bank account, which many sex workers do not have because they 
come from abroad. They had to open an account first, which meant that they received 
the money much later. It took a year until the regulations on the hardship fund w ere 
adapted accordingly. The need for a mobile phone signature also led to problems, and 
a Counselling Centre then offered extra courses for women. Many continued to work 
illegally because of the financial pressure. However, this leads to difficult situati ons, the 
women can be blackmailed and cannot turn to the police in dangerous situations. I also 
got offers to work illegally during the lockdowns. I had the impression that some people 
exploited this situation. I received dogy phone calls where I was offer ed a place to work 
from, and I got the impression they were doing this until the found a woman who took 
the offer. I also know that the during the long lockdowns some of my colleagues piled 
up debts. Especially migrant sex workers, who formally were not al lowed to earn money 
but also couldnt return to their home countries as the borders were closed, experienced  a lot of strain. And then, they were able to work for four months, could reduce their debts  
but not really save up money for the next lockdown, and so, the situation got worse and 
worse. Some sex workers were really in a hard place, they did not even have money to  
buy winter clothes for their kids, some lost their homes, while a few others received  
some social benefits and did not struggle so much.  
 
Even when the brothels were able to reopen, fewer visitors came because of contact 
tracing. Anonymity is a very important factor in sex work. In addition, many brothels 
closed during the pandemic and many women have not yet returned from illegality. As 
sex workers, we go for a health check every 6 weeks. Before the pandemic, there were 
about 3000 women who went to this check -up as sex workers. Now there are not even 
2000. This means that many have reduced or cancelled their self -insurance and are now 
workin g illegally or have taken another job to make ends meet.  
The vaccination was very important for me it was kind of a gift for me. When the number  
of infections went so high last year, I didn't want to work anymore  either. This is mainly 
due to hygiene  measures. As a sex worker, it is not possible to comply with all hygiene 
measures. For example, neither I nor my colleagues are wearing FFP2 masks, that is 
simply not possible. Clients think the sex worker is sick, if they are wearing a FFP2 mask. 
It is a lso difficult to keep a distance because, for example, I have  to check my client's 
breathing during certain BDSM practices. But testing is very important for me, in addition 
to vaccination. I test myself daily because I don't want to infect myself or the client. I also 
clean and ventilate even more thoroughly.  
 
During the pandemic, I founded an association, a kind of lobbying group. I was annoyed 
that sex work is always left out of press conferences. In particular, the lack of or unclear

United States,"''My name is Milena. I am 50 years old, and I work as a full -time caregiver in 
rural Austria. Originally, I am from Slowakia but I spend most of my time working in 
Austria. My patient uses a wheelchair and can hardly communicate anymore. I am 
working with th is client for 3,5 years. Working as a live -in caregiver is hard.  
Thinking about the pandemic, I predominantly think about social isolation. At the 
beginning of the pandemic, I could not go home. I stayed for a long time with my client 
which came with a massive physical and mental burden. At first, I didn''t recognize the  
signs and could not name social isolation as the main issue. During that time, I was 
constantly under pressure. Even when my mother passed away, I did not take the time 
to mourn. Recently I started to process what has happened. Living with my client feels  
like '''a prison to me''. My client feels the same way, he often misses his family.  
 
At first, I did not mind staying longer with my client, because it just did not make sense 
to go back to Slovakia where I would have to stay in quarantine until getting back to my 
work. I tried to negotiate with the family of my client whether they cover m y additional 
expenses. I did not receive any concrete answers. Without my knowing, the placement 
agency suggested to all families to pay every care giver an additional 20 EUR per day for 
motivation and compensation. My client''s family refused to pay such b onus and instead 
suggested that I work for them privately, without the agency. I refused because I have to 
think about my future. Without an agency it is not possible to find new clients (because 
 
 
    
 
there is no trust in foreign caregivers).  
 
A big factor that concerns me is the behaviour of my client's (adult) children. I agreed on 
a new rotation rhythm (staying for 4 weeks in a row, instead of 2) with my colleague. This 
was only possible because we both own a car. Otherwise, crossing the bord er would 
hardly have been possible. The client's family assured me and my colleague of their 
support, but in the end,  they didn''t do it. They never showed up. However, the longer 
rotation entitled us for the 500 euro '''stay here'' ('''bleib da Wohnen'') bonus. In retrospect, 
I do not think that these 500 euros were worth the effort, it is too little money for the 
burden.  
 
The children underestimate how much work I have with my client. At the same time, they 
are rarely around. I find this particularly difficult because all the things that need to be 
done around the house are put on my shoulders, though they are not covered b y my 
contract. I earn 800 euros net, '''no man would do this job for so little money''. For 
example, when it is snowing,  I must clear the 100 -150 m2 driveway so I can drive my 
client to the doctor. These are also physically demanding tasks that put additional  strain 
on me and my colleague (who is 61 years old). The fact that the client's children don't 
think about the different chores irritates  me a lot. I see cultural differences here; in 
Austria it is assumed that you just ask when you need something. So, I address 
everything directly, but there are no consequences. For example, when I brought up the 
problem with the housekeeping, that I don't  have time to clean and iron because the 
client can't be left alone and I can hardly keep to my breaks, the children s uggested that 
they come for coffee, and I could clean the windows or iron the cloth in the meantime. I 
found that insulting, because when visitors come, I would like to have a chat with them 
and tell them how things are going. This just shows you, they do not realise what is going 
on and how social isolation affects people.  
 
My client shows me that he knows how I feel and how exhausted I am. Sometimes he 
says, I should go home. But I cannot leave him alone. In the meantime, I tried to raise 
awareness with my client''s family. I was thinking about taking a break. But in the end the 
break is not going to solve the underlying problems. Furthermore, I need the money 
because I must cover my expenses like social insurance, which I would have to pay even 
if I do not earn income. I am only entitled to sickness pay after six weeks.  
 
I am vaccinated, but I think that I don't really need it because I have a strong immune 
system. When I realised that vaccination is necessary for crossing borders or easier that 
constant testing, I got the vaccination at the first opportunity in spring. No w I am also 
boosted, as are my colleague, the client and the client's family. Then again, my agent 
from the agency does not advocate for the vaccination. She has strongly opposed any 
kind of mandatory vaccination for 24 -hour caregivers and does not comply with any 
safety measures herself (such as wearing a mask during monitoring visits or showing 2G 
proof). Legally, I have a right to work in an 2G environment. But I didn't dare ask my 
agent for a 2G certificate. I think I'm just lucky that everyone around m e and the client 
are vaccinated and get tested before they come visit. Otherwise, I would have to quit 
because I can't force anyone. In addition, my workplace is the client's home. I find it 
difficult to take on such a role in someone''s home. I don't wear a mask while working, I 
estimate the risk of infecting my client as very low. I test myself before and after every 
trip. 
 
I have noticed that many 24 -hour caregivers are not vaccinated. Especially Romanian 
caregivers are very critical, but they are becoming the largest group of caregivers from 
abroad. This is because wages in Austria are not getting any higher, but the exchan ge 
rate between Austria and Slovakia, for example, is converging. This means that the 
incentive for Slovakian women to come to Austria is decreasing. This is not yet the case 
in Romania.  
 
I see the fact that many are vaccine skeptical  as a kind of defiant reaction against the 
government. Live -in caregivers have been  waiting for years now that their working 
conditions improve, but the government does not do anything; now they are asking the 
caregivers something and caregivers can say no . I find this childish, but I can understand 
it to some extent. Our job is simply not appreciated. The work we do now was unpaid 
for a long time and was done by women. Now it is still done by women, the work i s paid 
but poorly and receives no financial or '''moral'' appreciation. I see the state as 
responsible for this, as it creates the frame of the working conditions. People, like my 
client's family, act accordingly and use the leeway they are given. As a 24 -hour caregiver, 
I can't even negotiate my working conditions myself, it's all done through agencies that 
may be pursuing completely different interests.''","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,"I am vaccinated, but I think that"
United States,"My name is Anne, I am 43 years old and work as a self -employed sex worker 
and sexual companion. I was an accountant for years before I decided to become a sex 
worker.  
 
The pandemic meant a rather unfortunate start to my new profession, as I finished my 
training in sex counselling in October 2020, just before the lockdown began. This had 
financial consequences; I was longer unemployed than I anticipated. I had to fall bac k 
on my savings. In addition, I registered as marginally self -employed, so I can work in 
between, but not illicitly. This turned out to be disadvantageous, because although I did 
not generate any income during the lock down, the rest of the time I was abov e the 
marginal earnings threshold. Now, it looks like I'll have to make repayments of some 
social benefits which are disproportionate to what I have earned. '''The pandemic is 
taking its toll on me financially''. Fortunately, I still have some savings.  
  
In general, everything seemed very slowed down by the pandemic, nothing was 
predictable during this time. This also has psychological consequences, thoughts 
revolve more around oneself, fears arise. I noticed that I reacted much more emotionally 
and was ve ry listless at times.  
 
Sexual counselling was not prioritised in the pandemic, just as people perhaps went to 
the hairdresser less, sexual counselling was also given lower priority. Also, in order not 
to put people at additional risk. '''Everyone is a bit reserved.'' During a pande mic, inviting 
a stranger to one's home certainly is an overcoming. The fear that others might find out 
also plays a role. Nevertheless, there was pressure from clients to work illicitly. Several 
unpleasant requests came by phone and email from people who I  think would normally 
go to a brothel. '''I've just had really unpleasant enquiries.'' So, there is definitely a 
demand, but the implementation is simply not possible. This costs a lot of time but does 
not bring in any revenue . 
 
Even while we were allowed to work, there is no certainty in planning. Even when 
appointments are made, because the demand has not diminished, they are cancelled 
due to quarantine cases in the facility. This is all at the expense of my time capacities. 
Mak ing appointments costs time, possible travel time and costs, which were  sometimes 
not appreciated by my clients. Appointments were cancelled at short notice.  
 
Due to an immune disease, I was vaccinated early on and only work with people who are 
vaccinated. Sometimes I bring antigen tests if they don't have a current PCR test. I also 
communicate this very clearly on my website and do not discuss it. I can't keep the mask 
on and I know that my colleagues don''t work with masks on either. If I worked with a 
mask, I would not be booked. I also find some of the suggested hygiene measures 
simply not sensible. Sex work is very close and very intimate, neither a mask nor gloves 
will protect me. That's why I minimise the risk by focusing on vaccination and testing. Of 
course, there is still a residual risk, but I don't think the mask will change that much. But 
that doesn't mean I'm careless. Before I have seen the valid tes t result, I wear a mask and 
greet at a distance. It is not only me who worries about this, but also my clients.

and board member of a feminist association. I experienced the pandemic as the 
daughter of a mo ther who was ill with cancer and needed care as well as an adjunct 
teacher at university (see AT09).  
 
At the beginning of the pandemic, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. We live very 
close to each other, almost flat to flat. Due to the advanced stage of her illness, she 
needed a live -in caregiver. Her live -in caregiver came from Hungary and decided to s tay 
with my mother during the first peak phase of the pandemic, which lasted 9 weeks. The 
government bonus of 500 euros for live -in caregivers certainly played a role, but it was 
not easy to get it. For example, she had to have an Austrian bank account. I helped her 
with this and was also very busy with the organisational side of things. So, I looked after 
the caregiver, who in turn looked after my mother. Again and again problems arose, 
sometimes it went well for a week, then it didn't. My mother wasn't very easy either, I 
often had to calm the caregiver  down. It was also difficult for me at times, my mother did 
not speak to me. The doctor said that everything was still going well compared to other 
families. Nevertheless, I would not want to experience something like this again. My daily 
routine was that I worked in my home office and went over to my mother's 4 -5 times a 
day, and I was permanently on call. Medical care seemed to be difficult during that time; for example, the general 
practitioner stopped coming. The hospital discharge management didn't make it easy 
for us either. The diagnosis, as well as the medication, was not passed on to the treating 
doctors, we had to do that ourselves. There was a clear communication gap between 
hospital and home medical care. The attending doctors, such as our general practitioner 
and a palliative care doctor communicated with each other, but that took time. The 
pallia tive doctor continued to come about once a week. With the help of a local 
association, we were able to arrange the care well. This association is private, and we 
could only afford it because my mother was well off financially with her widow's pension. 
I could not afford it with my pension. I am wondering why this type of care is not better 
supported by the government, considering it would be cheaper and more decent  than 
a place in a retirement home. Anyway, they work in small teams, caregivers and 
shopping helpers come in turns. It's a great model, much more humane than others. The 
care staff has more leeway in terms of time, now, for example, compared to other 
providers. The live -in caregiver and I didn't wear masks because my mother could no longer really 
understand what was happening pandemically due to her illness. And the constant 
wearing of masks by the people around her also meant an additional psychological 
burden. But that also had the consequence that I no longer met anyone. I only went 
shopping during this time to minimise the risk of infection. Collecting medicines from the pharmacy worked well. Since the pandemic, prescriptions 
are now sent directly from the practice to the pharmacies by email, so you don't have to 
sit in the waiting room at a time like this. Nevertheless, I have the impression that there 
was little exchange between the different health providers, and there is also a lack of 
data on the pandemic.  
 
My mother then passed away, so we also had to organise the funeral in Corona time. At 
the funeral there were also Corona cases, and my brother was positive afterwards. I'm 
not sure if I had it too. There were a few signs.  
 
So the topic of care work has already been very present in my life, both at home and as 
a researcher. I have dealt with it in the form of interviews and events. For me, it is one of 
the central issues that were neglected during the pandemic, although the s ituation has 
become more acute. Kindergartens have also been pretty much left out, in my opinion. 
Parents who are exposed to Covid through their children and have problems managing 
work life on the side with home office arrangements, etc. There was no disc ernible policy

approach in this area. In many areas, people's own responsibility was relied upon or 
pushed upon. '''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,I experienced the pandemic as the daughter
United States,"My name is Daniela, I am 37 years old and a sociologist. I live with my family, 
my husband and two children, on the outskirts of Vienna. My children go to kindergarten 
and school, we are doing well so far. We have adapted to the new pandemic situation 
and found a way  to deal with it well. So, we are happy that we have coped well.  
 
My live has several layers. For my family it had actually some good sites, as we had less 
pressure to do something, meet people, but could slow down a bit. We moved to the 
outskirts of Vienna. The different lockdowns and short work and later home office he lped 
my husband and me to balance work and family really well. '''Therefore, for us, some 
lockdowns had been really advantageous, as we managed to realise personal plans. ''  
Then again, the pandemic is challenging, if we want to meet friends and acquaintances, 
who have different opinions than us. My family and I see that the pandemic is one aspect 
of our ecosystem and we have to manage it so all goes well. We did not shut ours elves 
off, we did not simply pause our social life for two years. That would have had unbearable 
consequences for us. Rather, we tried to weigh up the measures to see what made sense 
for us and what made less sense  '''But there is a life after the pandemic and if we destroy 
all our social foundation, one would not expect that after two or three years things would 
work again, like before. '' I '' like my husband '' want to be a role model for our kids. We 
want to show them that it is possible to deal with a crisis. So we use the pandemic to do 
that. . In doing so, we were guided by our common sense.  
My extended family does not live in Austria, and this has been difficult during the 
pandemic. Not so much because it was more difficult to meet '' because with testing and 
vaccination we could overcome that. But, on an emotional level. Knowing that you are in 
 
 
   16 
 
another country, where the rules differ '' I did not want to confront myself with another 
set of rules. For me, it was difficult to overcome this or to motivate others to point out 
that it is not as bad as it is portrayed in the media.  
 
For me, having a balance is important to build up resilience and manage a crisis such as 
the pandemic. It was important for us to develop a new daily structure. Our daily 
structure included a fixed routine with fixed programme points that were followed 
without interruptions. This helped us to balance home office, the different chores in the 
household and child care. I see that as a big point in overcoming crises, to look at oneself 
and motivate each other to stick to the structure. Also, because we know the  risks if we 
don't stick to it. For sure, I experienced several moments of desperation, when I was not 
sure on how to deal with the next lockdown, or when we were insecure on whether or 
not to visit our relatives. But I then made my own assessment of the s ituation and found 
a way on how to make it work. Part of it was also adapting our diet to the new situation. 
For me, it is important to see what I can contribute to cope with a crisis.  
 
My daughter started school in September 2021, so the closures of schools at the 
beginning of the pandemic did not concern us much. The main effect I experienced was 
a change in the school''s admissions process; for example, I was not able to visit the 
schoo ls on site. But generally speaking, it worked okay. In my opinion, school is very 
important for students. My daughter always goes there, regardless of whether wearing 
masks or other measures are in place. Children perceive crises differently, they adapt to  
situations very quickly. For example, if they only know school with a mask, they don't 
question it.  
 
When I compare the situation in our family, my daughter is probably suffering the most 
from the pandemic. She feels the effects the most, but without knowing it herself. She 
doesn't have regular sports lessons, wears a mask all day and can't meet friends, she 
experiences a shock when a friend is tested positive. My son feels none of this in 
kindergarten. There is no distance, no masks. I may know the parents of the other 
children less, but that is also almost the only difference to my daughter's kindergarte n 
time. I'm especially glad that we live on the outskirts of town and have a garden. So, the 
children could go out even while they were in quarantine.  
 
I wasn't quite sure about the vaccination at the beginning, so I watched how it went. For 
us as a healthy family, I didn't think the vaccine was necessary, an infection wouldn't be 
dramatic for us. My husband and I finally got vaccinated in the summer, mai nly for 
reasons of social inclusion and because I didn't want to be constantly confronted with 
the topic. I still have concerns about long -term consequences of vaccination, but when 
weighed against the harmfulness of Covid, I prefer vaccination. After all,  the vaccination 
has been scientifically proven. I only did the third vaccination recently because I felt 
social pressure. Personally, I would not have considered it necessary. But then my 
certificate would have expired and I don't want to be harassed by t he state or experience 
social exclusion. The majority of my environment is also vaccinated, but there are also a 
few vaccination opponents. However, I don't get involved in conversations about the 
 
 
   17 
 
vaccines; I don't want this topic to cause a rift in my friendships.  
 
I think this pandemic will be just one of many. The climate crisis in particular will play its 
part.",['Domestic'],3,"I experienced several moments of desperation, when"
United States,"My name is Kerstin, I am 58 years old and a cardiologist. Five years ago, I sold 
my practice and developed a project for migrants. I experienced the pandemic from a 
privileged situation, but through my association work I got insights into the life of migrant 
families in Vienna and tried to intervene. The project focu sses on women from migrant 
communities. The aim is to gain access to '''women who are perceived as unfree'' through 
other women from their community. The latter are trained counsellors, who build 
''bridges'' to their community. Guided by the idea of a self -determined life, there is a 
strong focus on the labour market integration of migrant women. The counsellors are 
themselves an active part of their community.  
 
My life situation differs of the situation of women in our organisation. I consider myself 
to be in a privileged situation. My husband and I moved to our second residence during 
the pandemic, because at that time I was considered a high -risk patient after an 
operation. Since then, we have been living there very happily and will continue to do so 
after the pandemic. We have been vaccinated three times and are not at risk, we can 
regulate our contact with people ourselves. We do not have to work. On the other  end 
of the spectrum are the women who receive support from my association. They live in 
Vienna with small children in a very confined space and are therefore more at risk of 
infection.  
 
So, in the context of the pandemic, we started providing  our association's services 
online. I think the result of this has been very positive. We were able to develop a daily  
 
structure with families, and all family members were involved. In most of these families, 
there are very strict gender -specific divisions of labour. The wife or mother takes over all 
the household tasks. This became very clear during the pandemic when everyone was 
at home. It also became clear that it doesn't work like that. And since everyone was at 
home now and that was also difficult to bear, we were able to organise family 
conferences. In these conferences, we divided tasks fairly among all family membe rs and 
it was gladly accepted. We were able to break down traditional role models to some 
extent. The pandemic also allowed us to implement some ideas '' like coaching while 
walking '' which we always wanted to do, but did not manage before. We also develope d 
new formats, such as learning groups in the park, but I am not sure if this is indeed an 
advantage.  
 
However, the switch to digital also brought some problems. Many families only have one 
device. And if, for example, three children live together in one household and all have 
home schooling online, then at least one child misses out. Usually the youngest, because 
he or she is least able to assert him or herself. Teachers have a hard time including 
everyone, no matter how committed they are. The privileged families simply have an 
advantage, and the gap continues to widen. As an association, we have tried to react to 
this by collecting donations in the form of money, terminals and providing families with 
devices. But in the end, that was just a drop in the ocean. We also set up a Corona Chat 
on our homepage. Twice a week, we hosted a chat for 3 hours, where pe ople could ask 
questions in their own mother tongue.  
 
Even before the pandemic, part of our project was a sewing workshop where women 
could be trained as seamstresses. In this way, they were supposed to encounter western 
ideas of work and be integrated into life outside their own homes. We offer this training  
with the prospect of employment. Women pay 500 Euros and if they work for half a year 
after the training, they get the money back. At the beginning, the husbands strictly 
refused, but finally some of them agreed, simply to get the 500 Euros back. All of t hem 
have been employed for 6 years now and they like it very much. During the pandemic, 
they were put on short -time work. Very soon, some of our seamstresses contacted us 
and proposed we produce face masks. This went so well that we hired 2 more women.   
 
Our association also had to struggle with the fact that donations from investors 
decreased, but this was then compensated by other funds. But I found it laughable when 
expenses are increased everywhere and salaries rise, but the Ministry of Social Affairs 
refuses slight increases because they can't afford it. '''","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",2,I experienced the pandemic from a privileged
Austria,"My name is Kordula, I am 50 years old, and I am currently self -employed, 
working in the education sector focusing on training people so they can use technology 
in a self -determined way.  
 
During the pandemic, I lost all my clients, as they were either severely affected by the 
pandemic themselves or stopped their activities. This put me in a financial emergency, I 
had to draw on my savings right at the beginning. I also applied for different  financial 
benefits provided by the state. After two years of the pandemic, I am massively at risk 
economically,  especially because the support for one -person enterprises does not 
suffice. But it is also difficult to get out of self -employment because I am  not eligible for 
social benefits which other groups such as unemployed people or artist, can rely upon. 
I am currently in the process of organising my exit from self -employment. I have 
therefore also put my voluntary activities on hold. I am trying to fin d a regular job, which 
also provides for my social security.  
 
Nevertheless, I still consider myself privileged and have made it my task to support 
people in my environment. Here I see many problems in connection with the pandemic. 
Neighbours who do not have German as their mother tongue and who are also old have 
grea t problems in dealing with digital technology. But that is exactly what is increasingly 
expected. In the context of the pandemic, almost everything has been transferred to the 
digital realm. Testing, vaccination, and even other affairs with the city have b een 
digitised. For me, this is forced digitalisation. Older people had big problems with it, 
some of them don't even own a mobile phone and have no prior technical knowledge. 
But without a mobile phone signature, nothing was possible. In my eyes, a false s tandard 
has been established and this data collection makes me uncomfortable. I then started 
documenting all the digitalization measures in order to have evidence.   
 
In my opinion, the problem with this pandemic is not the virus, but the system. Problems 
are becoming visible that were there before and were simply never addressed. Neither 
before nor now during the pandemic. I see Austria's handling of the pandemic as not 
very efficient. Trust became less and less, also due to the way how the topic was covered 
by Austrian media. I have noticed an increasing scientification of the public discourse, 
whereby these figures only serve to legitimise the politicians' statements. The 
advertising campaigns or posters regarding measures of the pandemic were too 
flawless an d far from reality. For me, none of this adds up.  
 
What is needed is a system change, not a system maintenance. However, this system 
maintenance was clearly evident. Selfishness persists. For instance, when companies 
imported FFP2 masks, repacked them and increased the prices for it. I simply could not 
com prehend some of the measures, such as the closure of the Federal Gardens at the 
beginning of the pandemic. I didn't understand why I could no longer go for a walk 
there. Or when young people got fined 100 -150 EUR just because they were standing 
next to eac h other outside, holding their phones '' '''this has very much fueled  aggression 
and refusal against authorities and authoritarian measures''. Generally speaking, I have 
the impression that the aggressions and tensions have increased.  
 
I was also affected by the way the discourse of the pandemic took place. I refused to 
become part of this systems, by avoiding to engage in media. I feel that very often they 
only use buzz words, but do not really tackle the issues. It was more like a prop aganda, 
showing styled nurses in shiny places, but not reality. This created bubbles, which are 
floating around but don''t have any basis in reality. Now, you don''t see any faces any 
more '' that''s the same way how political campaigns worked in the 1990s: fi rst you see 
faces, then topics and in the end only where to tick the box.  
 
I think there should have been many more opportunities, real opportunities, for people 
to be self -responsible. Because  people want to protect themselves and their relatives. 
But instead, they  opted to collect plenty of data. Also, the tools that have been 
developed, like the app for testing, is designed badly, so it is not comprehensible for 
people how to use it, and you could not use them on small displays.","['Public Space', 'Workplace']",1,"I am currently self -employed, working"
United States,"''My name is Andrea, I am 42 years old and work part -time in a covid -free 
hospital as gynecologist . I have two small kids; one was born during the pandemic. My 
husband is from Asia. In addition to my work in the hospital, I have a private practice and 
volunteer for in the public Covid -screening and vaccination programme. In the past I 
worked in several  countries of the global South.  
I was pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic. At that time there was a lack of 
knowledge. The lax approach of the public to issues related with sickness stood out to 
me. For instance, there have been pregnant women who brought their sick kids to their 
doctor''s appointment which is a risk for other patients, not just during the pandemic. For 
me it was clear even before the pandemic '' something I picked up in my work in the 
 
 
    
 
global South '' that whenever I catch a cold, I am wearing a mask. This is the best way to 
protect myself and my patients. Consequently, the mask mandate in the public transport 
came as a relieve for me, as now none was wondering why I wear a mask.  
 
The first lockdown was very stressful for me. So many things have been uncertain. I did 
not know, for instance, whether my husband would be able to accompany me when I 
gave  birth, or whether my parents were able to stay with us and help us out. In the end, 
both were  possible, but still there was a lot of insecurity.  
I felt quite conflicted as well. As a physician, I wanted to help and fill in when help is 
needed . Especially, because I became a physician because I wanted to help people. As 
a mother, though, I was afraid of Covid. Not so much for getting sick myself, but that I 
would pass it on to my loved ones and that they would have a severe diseases 
progression . Also, the issue of Long Covid came to my mind, which is especially 
prevalent amongst women of my age group. I have the impression we do not get 
enough inform ation on Long Covid. For instance, we never learn about how many 
people are actually in rehab, due to Long Covid. They should communicate this better.  
 
Luckily, childcare  was not an issue for me. I was on maternity leave, when the 
kindergartens were closed due to the high numbers of infection. As soon as the numbers 
went down I sent my kind to the kindergarten again. I had to fight, though, with the 
kindergarten''s director , insisting that the risk is low and therefore my kid should not be 
denied this opportunity. I am afraid that less educated and less privileged families did 
not get the same support. Especially the migrants'' kids, who would benefit from t he pre -
school year. The motto was kids should stay at home as much as possible. I think that as 
a consequence of this motto, those most in need of support did not receive it.  
 
Generally speaking, I think much more education is needed. I reached out to the health 
ministry several times urging them to provide better information on how to protect 
oneself, e.g. how to wear a mask, as a lot of people don''t seem to understand that the  
mask should cover mouth and nose, especially when you come close to each other and 
speak. I saw people remove their mask when they are speaking to someone else. Also, I 
got the impression that better educated people are more open to getting vaccinated. 
Normally, I vaccinate people in a predominantly working class and migrant area, but 
once I was in a more affluent area. And there, to my surprise, people thanked me for the 
vaccination, which was a first for me.  
 
I get annoyed when people who do not know what they are talking about provide 
guidance. I am working with a lot of pregnant women and I know that getting covid while 
you are pregnant can be really risky, while the vaccination is rather safe for most 
pregna nt women. Once a neurologist told one of my high risks patients not to get 
vaccinated during the pregnancy, even though for her the vaccine would be really 
important. This annoyed me.  
 
I got vaccinated rather soon, as I interrupted my maternity leave in winter 2021. Luckily, 
this was the time when health care professionals received the vaccine. I was also happy 
 
 
   26 
 
that by then the hospitals had enough PPE (personal protective equipment), like FFP2 
masks. This was not the case in the first lockdown, when I bought my own masks.  
 
I hope that people receive more education so they better understand that it is not just 
about their own, individual progress but that they also have a responsibility for the 
community. This includes to question mountebanks and to be able to change one''s mi nd 
if one comes to the conclusion that what one thought was perhaps not right after all. '''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",1,"I had to fight, though, with the"
United States,"''For me the pandemic has been really challenging, especially during 
lockdowns and in the winter time. All my artistic work as drag queen came to a halt; 
online shows have not been as satisfying. I miss the possibility to go and study in the 
coffee house or  library. Also, the psychological barrier to meeting  is much higher, and 
many people retreat into the private sphere. Moreover, at the beginning of the 
pandemic, there was a strong focus on the patriarchal nuclear family; other family 
concepts and other re ference people were hardly mentioned in the discussion about 
measures and who is allowed to meet. This increased my feeling of isolation.  
Luckily, I was not able to work from home. I work as a social worker in a shelter during 
the night. So, I had a reason to change my location , which was good for me. Then again, 
I rarely met anyone at work either, as there have not been any team meetings. Which 
was a shame.  
 
 
    
 
 
I am enrolled in a study program for social work, which started in autumn 2019. I was 
able to start with in -person classes, so I had the chance to meet my colleagues in real life 
back then. However, then came the pandemic and we all switched to distance le arning, 
which sometimes did not work very well. Eight hours a day, five days a week in a video 
call is really exhausting. Imagine, doing group dynamics in a video call with 50 people! 
This was strenuous. Through distance learning, the laptop, a tool I used  for your 
entertainment and pleasure, became my working tool. And, I didn''t have the chance to 
process the things we discussed in class. The topics we are learning  are really tough, 
such as child abuse and psychiatry. And then these topics stay with you, as you don''t 
change the scenery and cannot  chat with anyone about it. The university offers too little 
in the way of support for us students.  
Overall, the experience is one of isolation. Going for a walk is nice, but you don't get to 
talk to people you don''t know yet. In private life, people are withdrawing more,  and 
more, and online dating apps are mainly about sex, so friendly, social exchange also falls 
by the wayside. So, I am not surprised that around me I see a lot of dysfunctional 
dynamics. Drug consumption  really increased, as did the number of people with 
depression and mental health issues in my surroundings . 
 
As a German citizen, I have quite some privileges compared to other migrants, 
considering my first language is German and that people from North -West Europe are 
often treated better than other migrants. Still, I experienced discrimination though I have 
lived  here for 10 years now. When I am working, I hardly get any homophobic insults. 
But I am regularly insulted due to being perceived as a migrant. As a migrant, you always 
have to work harder, because you don''t know the unwritten rules. Moreover, I miss the 
structures, the institutions such as queer youth centers where you can go. So, in total, I 
experienced my share of exclusion.  
 
To be honest, I think as a queer person I am well prepared. When I grew up, I had to 
come to grips with AIDS as this was always a topic. So being seen as a virus spreader 
and having to get tested is nothing new to me. I learnt back then, by learning about AIDS, 
that it is important to communicate clearly. This helps me right now as well. My usual 
coping strategies to deal with stress don''t work in the pandemic, as I am not able to go 
and work in the coffee house. So, currently I am thinking about going some where else, 
where I can sit outdoors  and meet people. Because I don''t want to live another winter 
like the last one. '''I need more, other input!''  
 
As a social worker I got vaccinated rather early. Here again, the examination of what to 
do about AIDS  helped me to assess the risk. To me it was clear, I want to get the vaccine. 
The first meds against AIDS had a lot of severe side effects '' compared to them, the 
vaccine is harmless. Also, a few years back I had to fight cancer, and compared to the 
chemotherapy  '' it was out of question that I get vaccinated. We actually talked about the 
vaccines in my study program. And we said that a lot went wrong in politics in  the way 
this was communicated. They should not have said that the pandemic is over, this raised 
wrong expectations.  
 
 
   28 
 
 
I want to stress that more queer structures are needed. You could see during the 
pandemic  how fatal this lack of structures is, because people did not know where to turn 
to for help. There hardly have been any self -support groups or contact point for trans 
people. There is no place where you, as a queer person, can go to and don''t have to 
expl ain yourself. This is something the majority society fails to understand.''","['Education', 'Domestic']",1,"I had to fight cancer, and compared"
United States,"''My name is Gerlinde, I am 61 -years old, married and have grown up 
daughter who started her study programme abroad at the beginning of the pandemic. 
I live on the countryside , in a house with a garden , and have to commute for work. I am 
the managing director of a care facility for people with disabilities.  
 
To me the pandemic was '''demanding on all levels'', even though I try to see the positive. 
In my job, the demands increased drastically. Managing the pandemic didn''t make work 
for people with disabilities easier. As managing director, I am responsible for my  co-
workers and the people they  care for. I myself do not provide care for the clients, but I 
see that this has become  much harder for my staff. They are at the limit of their powers  
 
and need a lot of energy to stay positive and not despair. Constantly, people had to 
cancel their shifts, either because their kids or themselves have been in quarantine, or 
because the school or kindergarten closed. Also, the mask mandate made work more 
difficult. You have to know, normally the caregivers would sit at the same table with their 
clients, having  a joint meal. But due to the mask mandate, the caregivers were not 
allowed to join the people they support. This makes things harder, because in our work 
such informal settings are very crucial. Or, when there was the 2G+ rule in place (only 
vaccinated, recovered or PCR -tested people were allowed to meet) '' we had a lot of 
troubles, because we did not get access to the required tests. Before that the 
government would provide us with Anti -Gen tests, also for our clients. But then, 
suddenly, we had to make a lot of appointments in testing facilities. And also get to the 
testing facilities. Something the caregivers had to manage aside from their normal wor k. 
They had to register every single client and go to a pharmacy with every single 
unvaccinated person on a regular basis. '''No one sees, what we have to accomplish.''  
 
At the beginning of the pandemic, we had to keep our facilities open. But no one could 
tell us, how we should do that '' there was no guidance. As a managing director, I had to 
decide by myself on how we manage the risks of the pandemic. All public policies  and 
measures were announced on such  short notice. So it was up to me how to deal with 
that. I had to carry this responsibility by myself. It would have been helpful if we had had 
some clear rules and guidance. Also, it happened rather often '' especially when Covid 
infections numbers were high '' that the people in quarantine did not get their official 
''notification for isolation''. This is hard for me, because then I don''t know if I  am able to 
get the funding for a replacement person, or if I need to ask the staff member to go on 
annual leave, though they are in quarantine.  
 
My staff got some small bonus from the region for their care work and the extra strain 
the pandemic put on them. However, they were rather unhappy about that, because it 
was a really small amount and did not make up for all the troubles they had to deal with. 
It felt more like a mockery than  real recognition for all our accomplishments.  
To deal with the shortage of skilled workers, I asked retired personnel  whether they 
could join us and help us out. I was pleasantly surprised that almost all said yes and 
volunteered. This was a big luck and relief  for me, because they knew how the job goes. 
And it showed me that they actually liked working in my organisation and still feel 
connected to it. Nevertheless, I had to figure out how I can compensate them for their 
work.  
 
A lot of external support disappeared,  and the caregivers had to rescue the situation. 
They had to provide much more relationship building, as people with disabilities have 
been really isolated. All the support structures, such as youth coaching or support from 
the job  centre, just broke off.  '''It will probably be years before we really see all the effects 
of this. In any case, many young people have fallen into the void because the structures 
have collapsed.''  
 
As for vaccination, I am vaccinated, so is the vast majority of my staff. As a line manager, 
 
 
   30 
 
I have to seek a dialogue with the unvaccinated staff. I have they feeling they are under 
immense  pressure and experience this situation as very exhausting as well. Because, it 
is hard for them, if someone else has to fill in for them when they have to go into 
quarantine. Still, I try to convince them to talk to a physician so they can get some well -
founded information. But I try not to put more pressure on them. '''","['Public Space', 'Workplace']",1,I have they feeling they are under

do receive help from a local care organisation called ''Familiehulp'' (''Fam ily Assistance'') 
and from a volunteer carer who I''ve known personally for years, as she also used to take 
care of my mother. Besides the fact that my age somewhat affects my ability to do the 
chores and tasks of daily life, I also have a hearing impairment  for which I use a hearing 
aid. 
 
When the pandemic had just started, the people from Familiehulp and the personal 
volunteer kept helping me, while being a lot more careful. They went out grocery 
shopping for me and also served as my main social contacts during the pandemic, as I 
wasn''t ab le to go out with my friends anymore. Shopping  is very useful, but sometimes 
you forget to ask for certain items and then you have to wait a few days before you can 
actually get them. I also haven''t been able to buy any new clothes since March 2020. I 
can''t complain about the general quality of the pe rsonnel from Familiehulp, but because 
they have staff shortages due to Covid  infections, they''re often sending different people 
from one week to the next, which means that I don''t know them very well and I can''t get 
to know them either. Before Covid -19, th ey also used to come at more predictable hours, 
but now it has become quite irregular. That being said, I''m very happy that this 
organisation exists. You do have to pay for it, of course, but it is tied to your income or 
pension level, so I pay a fair pric e. 
 
There is no vaccination centre in my town, so I had to go to the nearest city to get my 
shots. Luckily, my health insurance organises safe transport (a car with plastic dividers 
inside) to and from the centre. You do have to pay for the drivers expenses, which is 
doable for me, but might not be for others with a lower income. A doctor checks up on 
my health every month, but I don't go see any other medical professionals anymore 
unless it is absolutely necessary: for instance, I want to go to a dermatologis t for a minor 
procedure, but it can be postponed until after the Covid  wave.  
 
The most difficult part about the pandemic is the social impact: I rarely see friends in 
person anymore, not only because there are risks involved, but also because finding 
good transport has become more difficult and because the cultural sector has dried up, 
so there is little to do. You do get more phone calls, but there have been a lot of lonely 
evenings. I encounter more difficulties when talking to people in person as well, because

they are usually wearing masks which make it harder for me to hear what they are actually 
saying.  
 
I think that, in general, people who are older than 80 years old are not heard enough. 
This applies to all of the politics around Covid , but also to more general trends as well 
(banks closing their physical locations, for instance). We do not have a powerful voice 
and we aren''t making ourselves heard enough. Instead, we usually get younger people 
protesting the Covid  measures, but they don''t seem used to anything. I know you can''t 
convey this to a younger person, but if they had experienced the war they wou ld have a 
different perspective.","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",1,I know you can''t convey this to

old and I have been working there for seven years in the same unit. I did three years of 
nursing and one year of specialisation in medical imaging and I have just finished a 
master 's degree in medical sciences. I'm not Belgian, I'm Burundian by origin and I've 
been in Belgium for 14 years. I have started like other by being to a reception centre, 
then got my papers and started studying. At the beginning of the crisis, wor king 
conditions were very difficult in the hospitals: no masks were given and if you had one, 
you had to put your name on it, keep it on all day, or write down how many you had 
taken. '''We were sent to the battlefield without ammunition, we had no equipment . We 
had to treat all patients even if they had covid. We work with immunocompromised 
patients so it is also dangerous for them, but we had no protection. We were sent to the 
floors to help without knowing the patient's information. We had colleagues who c aught 
the covid and contaminated the others. As we were short -staffed, we were obliged to 
work even if we had Covid, unless we didn't really standing anymore on our legs. We 
 
depended on the authorities, and when you love what you do you '''sacrifice'' yourself a 
little.  It was really hard.  Today, the situation remains complicated, we can't afford to be 
tested every day. There is nothing organised by the hospital. A fortnight ago, I went to 
the pharmacy to buy a self test  myself, I had to pay for it myself, I was not reimbursed. As 
the test was positive, I was prescribed a PCR test and this confirmed that I had caught 
Covid. I had caught it in hospital, but still I had to pay for  the test myself. I find that the 
hospital could have reimbursed me the 8 euros for the test. The hospital's policy is to 
make you work, you have to have really bad symptoms to stop working. Otherwise, the 
hospital would have to close down due to lack of c aregivers.  They need us. Nobody 
dares to complain to the management because they are afraid of the consequences too.  
We have heard about extra money from the authorities for nurses, but where is it? We 
don't see anything. It's given to the hospitals and we don't see anyone coming to 
reinforce the teams, nothing has changed. What has this money been used for? we are 
given less and less time to care for patients. Before we had 15 minutes, now we are given 
10 minutes, it means that we don't know how to take care of patients properly, we do a 
minimum of cleaning, we don't have time to give them all the information on the services 
available outside the hospital. I don't understand how patients don't rebel, they pay a 
lot for a bad service. There are aspects tha t are totally illogical in this crisis because we 
hear that we have to be careful, to protect ourselves and others and in particular to be 
vaccinated. But when you go home by public transport, we are all on top of each other, 
there is no way to respect the  distances. Today they want to impose vaccination on 
nurses, but we have been exposed to the virus for months without any weapon, without 
protection. I am vaccinated, but I have a colleague who is not and who told me that she 
would leave the profession if vaccination became compulsory for us.  I also work in a 
private testing centre (in a chemistry), and the test costs 32 euros. It's impossible for 
many people to pay that every time he or she wants to do an activity, like going to a 
restaurant. If you have money, you take your car, you pay for the test, but for the others 
who have to take public transport, who have to pay again and again for tests if they want 
to travel, have hobbies or visit a person in hospital.","['Healthcare', 'Workplace']",0,"I am vaccinated, but I have a"

I live in Belgium since  3, I didn't study much and I don't speak French very well, but 
I get by.  My husband works and we are lucky because during the crisis the company he 
worked for went bankrupt and he was unemployed for almost a year. It was very difficult, 
the rent is quite expensive, it's increasing, the bills are increasing but the salary is the 
same. It's very difficult for us because if we get 1200 -1300 euros and the rent is 1000 
euros, what do we have left? Nothing at all.  If I have to shop, I always go to the cheapest 
shops ( Aldi, Lidl). Some people can go to the other shops,  but we can't.  
 
Normally, children's studies are free but sometimes we have to pay for homework 
support, school trips. We haven't moved since 2018 because we don't have the money 
to do so and then there were difficulties (her husband is not vaccinated) but anyway we 
don't have the money.  
 
I'm looking for work, if I could find it easily, but I didn't study for it and I have back 
problems, but if I could do some shopping and be useful to people, that would be good. 
At the moment I am stuck with the children at home. I signed up for sewing classes and 
paid for it and then finally it stopped because of covid and for me now it's not possible 
because I'm focused on the children and finding ac commodation. When I get one, I can 
go back to training. As we have everything in a box to be able to move, I don't even have 
the space to use my sewing machine (she shows me later that it is stuck on a table).                                                                                                                                        
 
Children don't have much space here. We were with them all the time, locked in the flat, 
we didn't know what to do with them, they were always watching TV. We can't leave 
them alone because they are still too small,  and the neighbourhood is not safe. My 
children share the same room,  and my daughter was attending classes in her room, the 
little one wanted to play, and she needed silence. It was not easy at all. I hope she finishes 
primary school well, that she will succeed. They say she's doing well. The tea chers were 
available to answer questions, I think it went well for her.   It was quite difficult with the 
little one who wanted to play but there is no one there, his sister has to study, there is a 
big difference in age, we mustn't make noise and he plays  a little with us but it's not 
enough, so he cries. he likes to play with the others but there is no activity, it's difficult. I 
know no one here, even with my sister's kids r, everyone stays at home.

United States,"''I am Betty and I am an 89 -year -old woman living with my 89 -year -old 
husband in an apartment in a big Belgian city. I have three children, each with their own 
kids, and I also have one great grandchild, who was born in January 2021. Because I 
have always d one the domestic and child -rearing work, I have never been employed 
and, as a result, I rely on my husband's pension, which is sufficient for us. I still do most 
of the chores around the home, doing the laundry and ironing clothes, cooking dinne r, 
etc. But I do get help cleaning the apartment from a nice woman (sent by a cleaning 
service) every two weeks. We have always really liked to travel and to have dinner in local 
restaurants, but we started doing this less and less due to our advanced age.  The onset 
of the pandemic has caused us to stop doing these activities completely. While it is 
disappointing, it was starting to become a fact of life that we wouldn''t be able to keep 
this up, in any case.  
 
The biggest impact I''ve felt from the pandemic was not being able to see my newly born 
great grandchild nearly as much as I would have liked. Whereas before the pandemic, 
there were regular family gatherings at our apartment or at one of my children''s home s 
for birthdays or Christmas, now we barely see each other. I''ve only been able to see the 
little one three times so far, so I''m missing him growing up and that saddens me.  
 
When the pandemic had just started, the woman who cleans our apartment kept coming 
over at her regular pace, so there was no trouble on that front. For a few years now, we 
are also visited by a physiotherapist every week who helps me with my severe back pa ins. 
He kept visiting during the early stages of the pandemic (and beyond) as well, so luckily 
my pain has not become worse. My husband used to swim regularly at the pool before 
Covid, but the only exercise he gets now is going to the grocery store. About a year ago, 
he was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis, which makes him tired pretty quickly and causes 
him to forget things, so that has made Covid somewhat harder and more frustrating on 
me. 
 
I am, however, very grateful that they managed to develop and provide vaccines so 
quickly, so that we could have people visit more often again. For our first two shots, we 
had to go to a vaccination centre that isn''t so close by, but they did provide us wi th a taxi 
service that cost us only 10 euros to go there and back. Guidance inside the centre was 
very good as well. For the booster shot, however, we had to provide for our own taxi: we 
had to pay 40 euros, which is fine, but I did have to think about all  those elderly people

who wouldn''t be able to afford something like that. I''ll gladly get my fourth shot 
whenever I will have to do so, which I suspect is soon. One thing I don''t understand is 
why some young people seem so intensely opposed to the vaccine: back when I was 
younger, we didn''t have nearly the amount of information available about medicine and 
vaccines as we do now, but we still got our injection without really complaining.",['Domestic'],3,"am, however, very grateful that they managed"
Belgium,"''My name is Charlotte. I''m a   -year -old woman from the Philippines, living 
in Belgium. I became undocumented around the time that the pandemic started.  I had 
come to Belgium as a student and  finished my Advanced Master with high distinction. I 
received an offer from a professor to do a Ph D, so I stayed. Legally, students have the 
right to stay in the country they graduated in for 9 months to look for a profession in their 
domain. However, this EU law had not yet been implemented in Belgium, and the 
Belgian bureaucracy was not replying to me . I therefore remained in a legal gray zone. 
It later turned out that my degree was not eligible to be recognized for Ph D funding. It 
was when this happened  that the pandemic also happened. Suddenly, I was 
undocumented during a global health crisis. This was very scary, and I lived in a 
precarious situation because I did not have any income, and I had to pay rent. I did not 
have any support system here. I had  been finding student jobs in manual labor and 
cleaning, but in my position, I couldn''t do it anymore du ring the pandemic.  
 
I did an internship in an NGO, but they paid me the volunteer rate, even though the work 
I was doing was at the level of a staff member. I demanded higher pay, which they did 
for 2 out of 6 months. I had to combine this with other freelance opportunities, that I 
received from my network back home. But there was a lot of uncertainty about my 
income, and a very high workload. Because of the constant anxiety and pressure, I had 
a burnout, and fell into a depression. This worsened when my landlord wanted me to 
move out, and in Belgium it''s difficult to get housing if you don''t have papers. Luckily, he 
allowed me to stay, but this took a heavy toll on me. And there is no break, and you 
constantly fear to be without income or to be ''found out'', even though I didn''t do 
anything wrong. I was applying for jobs, but got rejected a lot, because the skills I had 
from home were not recognized here. This was very bad for me, and the whole context 
gave me suicidal thoughts. I had some support here i n Belgium from my partner and 
 
others, but I needed improvements in my personal situation. But you can''t get papers 
without working, and you can''t work without papers, that doesn''t make sense. Around 
January of 2021, I found job with an international organization. I like the work, and it 
makes me feel valued. But I have to send my wage to the Philippines, and then let m y 
family send me the money, and we pay a lot of fees for that transfer. So, it''s still difficult, 
as long as I don''t get my papers. ''","['Workplace', 'Education']",0,"I was applying for jobs, but got"
Belgium,"''My name is Charlotte. I''m a 33 year old woman living in Belgium from the 
Philippines. After I finished my studies in Belgium, I became undocumented, around the 
time that the pandemic started.  I feared that I wouldn''t be able to access healthcare 
because of my status, or that I would die alone in a hospital in a country that is foreign to 
me. In this time period, I tried to be a student again, but because I didn''t have a legal 
residence status, this was denied and I was told to go home, even tho ugh it is a global 
pandemic,  and the situation was horrible in the Philippines. However, because I already 
known in the system, and because I told the insurance I was going to be a student (which 
I still believed at that point), they gave me insurance. This was good, but I was scared 
that somehow it would not be given anyway if they found out I had no legal status 
anymore. I got a very bad toothache at some point, and I waited 10 days to not go to the 
doctor, until it was too bad.  
 
Later on I found out that you can go to a municipality and ask for a health card that gives 
you basic access to healthcare, even if you are undocumented. But this information is 
not easily available, and it feels like they don''t talk about this on purpose.  As an 
undocumented person, you constantly feel scared to go to any official authorities, 
because you fear negative consequences. You need to show your ID when you want to 
access healthcare, and if you don''t have, you don''t know what will happen, and this 
creates a lot of stress and anxiety. And it was difficult to see people have access to such 
good healthcare, but be excluded from it, not be able to get help for burnout, 
depression, and other health issues.  
 
When the government sent masks to every citizen, I didn''t get anything. I was afraid I was 
going to miss out on the vaccine. Luckily, my partner and his mother called the 
 
 
vaccination center, and because I was already in the system somehow, they allowed me 
to get vaccinated, despite my status. But in Belgium you needed to have a certificate to 
prove your vaccination if you wanted to do things. But because of my status, I couldn''t 
use the digital services to get it. So my partner called and through my old ID number, 
they sent a paper certification. Government services don''t speak English usually, and 
they often can''t help you if you don''t fit in the right box. So, I was lucky to have people 
help me. I hope that your project can think what it means to be undocumented and  help 
undocumented people.''","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",1,I was going to be a student

practitioner in training. I am currently living with my partner, who is also in the medical 
field, in a (rented) house in a big Belgian city. I started to work/intern as a general 
practitioner as part of my education just before the beginning of the pandemic. While 
this work is formally still part of my education, I do get paid for it, I am able to build up 
my social rights (i.e., pension, unemployment benefits, ...) and I am treated like a normal 
colleague, so it can be co nsidered my first real job.  
 
When Covid started to gain ground in Belgium, a lot of people (temporarily) stopped 
coming to the practice I worked at and, because my supervisor was also responsible for 
the general health situation in a care home for the elderly, I basically started my '' GP'' job 
taking care of Covid -19-infected people living in a care home. I did this for about a 
month and it was hard, but I was in good hands luckily; my supervisor was always there 
to support me, and I could ask for assistance if there was something I was uncertain 
about. I also wasn''t responsible for specific patients, but I helped wherever it was 
needed. It was very impressive how quickly they managed to overhaul the care home: 
the cafeteria was turned into a sick bay and the hairdresser''s area was transformed into 
a makeshift intensive care unit.  
 
Back then, however, we had a very limited supply of face masks and only used the most 
protective ones when around Covid patients. When in other settings, we used the masks 
that were sewn by volunteers in the local area. Because I am young,  I wasn''t too 
concerned about catching the virus, but it still was something that was in the back of your 
mind. Ultimately, I haven''t contracted it to this day. Another problem we dealt with was 
a lack of oxygen, so we had to call around very frequently to  ensure that we h ad enough 
of a supply. It was difficult to see or hear of people passing away: sometimes after the 
weekend was over, you returned to find that some people you had gotten to know a little 
had succumbed to the illness. But in the moment, you don''t have time to dwell on that 
and you just keep going.  
 
A few months later, I graduated  and started an actual GP job/internship at a practice not 
too far from where I live. However, I did start when the second Covid wave was beginning 
to take off and I immediately had to adapt to those circumstances. I got my first real 
responsibilities, but  this was then combined with, for example, ensuring that there is 
always enough ventilation, wearing a mask and face shield, ensuring that the patients 
are allowed to be there (Covid tests were done in dedicated testing centr es at that time), 
etc. Those are all small things, but they add up and give a very different dynamic to a 
normal GP consultation. That''s what I imagine at least, as I haven''t worked in a ''normal'' 
setting yet.  
 
At some point in the fourth wave (fall -winter 2021), the responsibility for Covid testing 
largely fell on GP practices. It became extremely busy then, and it was frustrating to have 
lots of people with very mild symptoms come over and take up a spot that c ould''ve 
otherwise been reserved for people with other issues. Moreover, it has led to a huge 
administrative burden (which was already sizeable before), as we had to provide signed 
certificates to employers stating that people had to isolate themselves  and couldn''t 
make it to work. Right now, in the spring of 2022, the testing responsibility has been 
shifted away again and cases are dropping, so we''re approaching some semblance of 
normalcy, which I haven''t been able to experience yet.''","['Healthcare', 'Public Space']",1,"I got my first real responsibilities, but"
Belgium,"''My name is Donna, I am 61 and come from Southern Europe, but I''ve lived 
in Belgium for 30 years now. In the beginning of Covid, the uncertainty to what this virus 
is was stressful. No good information was available, no idea what could happen. My son, 
who has a disability, was studying in a big city abroad. My first concern when Covid 
started spreading was to see him and to have a plan B if it is serious. When I visited him, 
I saw that it was serious. My son didn''t want to come back to Belgium wi th me, but I didn''t 
want to leave him. In the end, we came home together. It was sad to see that big city so 
quiet.  
 
We managed to come back;  it was a relief but stressful because every small symptom 
could be Covid. This uncertainty was bad. And the idea that I could infect my son was 
horrible, a nightmare. There was a lot of information,  and I didn''t know what to believe; 
for example,  whether to wear a mask or not. The government  said masks don''t help, and 
I followed this advice. And it turned out masks do help. Politicians acted clueless and the 
caretaker government was  communicating badly. I felt that we relaxed and became 
complacent after WW2. No morality or responsibility from our leaders.  
 
At work, I was working with a bad boss, she just didn''t like me. She wasn''t talking to me, 
and cut meetings short with me. And the colleagues were unmotivated and unskilled. I 
had to carry the load for them. This lasted two years, and this ended with a bur nout 
during Covid. Covid enhanced this dynamic, because of teleworking and style of 
working and communication. I stayed in burnout for a year and a few months. Contact 
with the medical insurance was exclusively via phone. They  put me in a reintegration 
scheme, without telling me that it could mean that I could get fired easily without 
compensation. This was a nightmare, I had to look for a job at 61, with fear of losing 
everything. It's horrible to be sick, but to experience this. In the end, I got a job of fer. 
Starting this new job is not easy, but people are nicer. It is more  social, with more 
teamwork. I got used to teleworking, and I like the combination. I got used to the new 
circumstance and use the advantages of teleworking . I don''t feel bad if I work  less to 
relax, because I have given so much already.  
 
During Covid, I was happy to be in a country with good healthcare and social security. 
Even taxes felt fair. But since my son is in a risk group, I tried to ask for help to get 
vaccines early or  get some guarantee that son would get a spot in hospital if necessary, 
and this was not possible. And that was disappointing, because it was medically 
necessary. But this Covid was so bad, that I understand that there was some chaos in 
medical services. T he new government was better and had more active policies.

United States,"''I am a 15 -year -old female high school student from Pernik, Bulgaria. I live 
with my mother and my brother. I also spend weekends with my father who lives in the 
capital Sofia. My grandparents live in the nearby block in my hometown, so I see them 
almost e very day when I go to have lunch with them. In my everyday life, I go to school. 
I like to go out with friends, hang around town, and listen to music, and in summer, I like 
to take walks with my dog.  
 
The Covid -19 pandemic and the lockdown that we had because of it in 2020 was tough 
for me. The biggest change for me was that for three months, between March and June 
2020, I spent my time only with my family. I like them, but I missed going to school and 
being wit h my friends. I really missed socializing with people in school and being 
outside. I kept contact with my friends online, and we also sometimes talked on the 
phone, but it wasn't the same. I had the feeling the world is in a big crisis and all my 
family and friends too.  
 
After this strict lockdown in 2020 passed, we started meeting with my friends again. But 
I felt strange to be outside with many people. This still makes me feel very 
uncomfortable. Now in school, when the teacher wants me to examine me in front of the 
class, I get very nervous. I don't like having so many people looking at me. I often can't 
talk, or my voice trembles because I feel like I'm going to say something stupid in front 
of all these people.  
 
School is very difficult when we're online. In 2020/2021, we studied half online, half in 
person. The same is now in the winter of 2021/2022. Distant learning for me is not nice. 
At first, in March 2020, it was impossible. Our teachers had no idea how to u se all these 
digital tools because they are older and haven't worked with computers so much. Many 
of the teachers just sent us written presentations. We had to read and learn from them 
without having online live lessons because they didn't know how to do t his, or didn't 
want to do it. This was in Biology, Geography, and History. In Math it was also difficult 
even though we had online lessons. The teacher didn't have a blackboard to write the 
math problems, so she was only telling them verbally and it was re ally complicated to 
grasp anything. In Physical Education, the teacher was sending us presentations about 
different sports and also some exercises to do at home, but I don't think any of us did 
any of them. I almost didn't move or go out for months. When w e had long periods of 
online learning, I was getting very tired from being at the computer and on my phone 
the whole day. My head was hurting,  and I felt dizzy. Also in 2020 was my last year with 
my previous class and it was very sad we couldn't be together. I think this got us quite 
 
 
   45 
 
distanced from each other afterwards. I know that some of the boys in my class enjoy 
studying at home because they can play video games during the classes and their 
parents won''t know. But I get very distracted at home, and now I also get more easily 
distracted when we are in school too.  
 
I was very happy when we could go back to school in person. But they keep changing 
this because when there are many sick people in the hospitals, they close the schools 
again and we go online. When we have periods in school, some of the parents still want 
to keep their children at home, so even when we have live classes in school, some kids 
are online. The parents are either worried from the virus or they are afraid that if the kid 
gets sick, they will have to stay in quarantine with them too and won''t be a ble to go to 
work and so on.  
 
My family had some troubles during this period too. My mother kept her job, but my 
father couldn''t work during the lockdown and sometime  afterwards, so he had problems 
with money and couldn''t give so much to me. They were both worried and seemed not 
very happy. Also, at one point my grandparents got ill with Covid . My grandfather was 
very sick for a long time and even had to go to the hospital for two weeks. At some point 
I was really scared for him. My mom told me there was no oxygen in the hospital and that 
this was not nice for him. I got sick with Covid  in August 2021 also. We were at the 
seaside with my school class and most of us got ill. The rest of the people were fine, but 
I had a difficult time because I got pneumonia and had to go to the hospital. I was scared 
at first, but then not so much, but s pending time in the hospital was horrible. The 
conditions were bad,  and I couldn''t talk with my friends so much, and the doctors kept 
giving me antibiotics.''","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,I feel like I'm going to say
Italy,"''I''m a 68 -year -old woman and I live in Sofia in my own small flat. My husband 
worked in Romania for many years, so I almost always lived alone. My son is grown up 
and he lives away with his family. When my husband had to come home from Romania 
six years ago , just 10 days before his birthday, he had a heart attack and passed away. 
Since then, I was left completely alone.  
 
When the pandemic started, there was an immediate effect on my life. The international 
travel company I was working at fully stopped its activities because of the lockdowns and 
the closed borders. Even though I''m a pensioner for a few years now, I was work ing there 
for extra income and to be around people. I really wanted to keep working because this 
makes me feel alive. But for almost two years now, they can''t revive the company, so I 
can''t go back to that job.  
 
In general, I wasn''t that scared in the pandemic situation. I didn''t isolate myself fully as 
some people did. One of my cousins didn''t go out for three months and she went crazy. 
I went out every day '' I always found some tasks  to take care of. I still wanted to be 
around people. During the first lockdown, there was a stupid measure that said people 
couldn''t take walks in the park. You could only go there if you''re walking your dog (but 
you couldn't take a walk in the park with your child, for example). So I was taking the 
neighbor''s dog, just so I could take a walk outside.  
 
The biggest worry during the pandemic was about my elderly parents '' they were both 
above 85 years old. They lived in a village near Sofia and me and my sister, we had to 
find ways to bring them food and medicine almost every day. We were scared not to 
infect them with the virus. They never got sick from this though. They turned out to be 
more resistant than we thought. They died one by one in the next months, but from other 
causes.  
 
Losing my job was bad because it meant that I lost half of my income '' my salary was as 
much as my pension is. Since then, I''ve been trying to find a new job, but it''s very difficult. 
On the one  hand, I''m a pensioner and not everyone wants to hire elderly people. On the 
other hand, many businesses in the service sector just closed and sacked employees, or 
if they haven''t, the salaries are miserable. So it''s very difficult. I would be very happy t o 
find a job that''s, say, half a day, so I can better support myself financially.  
 
Even though I think I''m quite tough and I''m dealing well with all the challenges, I lost half 
of my teeth during this period. I don''t know if it was the pandemic, the stress from having 
to take care of my parents in these conditions or from their death, or  just my age. But 
also,  it feels really bad to be thought of as old '' like this measure that the government 
introduced that 65+ year -old people can go to the shops only at certain hours during 
the day. That makes you feel really bad '' that you''re thought o f as that old.  
 
I''m really worried about the separation in society today. There is so much hatred, social 
frustration and anger. Society got split already at the start of the pandemic, and at that 
time also, the measures were completely stupid. For example, tourist buses from Italy 
were arriving and nobody was checking them '' if people who  were arriving were sick. 
Everything was so chaotic. At the same time, politicians and the media were creating 
panic about how serious the virus is and how the body bags won''t be enough f or all the 
people who are about to die. '''","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,I was working at fully stopped its
United States,"''I''m a 65 -year -old woman and I live in Sofia with my husband in our own 
apartment. We are both pensioners, but we still work because we are quite active. I have 
three children who are grown up and live away from us. My profession is a literary 
translator, e ditor and publisher. I've been running a small independent publishing 
house for many years now. My parents died a long time ago, as did my husband's, so we 
are the eldest members of our family.  
 
My everyday work situation did not change that much with the Covid -19 pandemic. My 
work is quite sedentary '' it involves sitting at the computer during the whole day 
because I''m either translating or editing, or preparing funding applications for my 
publishing house. So in this sense, my day -to-day life didn''t change so much. But before, 
when I would go out to get some chores done around town, I always tried to walk as 
much as possible. Now I go out less often because of the pandemic and I have less 
contact  with bookstores and book sellers. The long hours at home have a negative 
psychological effect, and I miss both the physical movement and the live socialization 
with colleagues and partners.  
 
I never had a big financial return from my publishing house, so it was always my husband 
who was supporting the family. The sales have always been small, but now there is an 
additional decrease also. The biggest negative impact from the pandemic on my 
indu stry is that many small bookstores closed. For publishing houses like mine '' small 
and more boutique '' this is a big deal because this type of bookstores was a big partner 
for publishing houses like mine. So this is a big change, and it has both a negative  
financial effect and a negative impact on how I can distribute my books.  
In addition, less literary readings are held and less and less publishers make book 
premieres. I couldn''t go to Frankfurt for one such big event last year, which is a pity. I got 
the news that more than half of the publishers didn''t go at all. The big literary festival 
here in Bulgaria was held online. But I don''t feel like virtual realit y will be able to steal 
me. I think it''s a very big issue for the world, this virtual world '' but I think us elderly  
people are less susceptible to that.   
 
I haven''t been to a theater play, cinema or a concert for two years because I''m afraid I 
may get sick, even though I''ve been vaccinated. This makes me very sad. I really miss 
this cultural life because it''s very important for me. Also, I usually buy books at the book 
market because I get discounts from other publishers. I always buy more books than I 
can read and more than I can afford actually. I love spending hours walking around the 
market to choose books . Now, I don''t spend so much time there because it''s in a closed 
space where a lot of people go, and I''m afraid I may get ill.  
 
Isolating elderly people during the lockdown and in general during this pandemic is 
truly unpleasant. History shows that isolation is always the predecessor of new 
totalitarian regimes. I never identify myself so much with my age. I''m also not so sure that  
I am so much more vulnerable to the virus than others. I don''t think it''s a good idea to 
put this into the heads of elderly people because they can panic and get scared. It''s 
important if a person gets sick, that they don''t panic because then they block t heir 
immune system. There was a rule for some time that elderly people could do their 
shopping in stores  only at certain hours of the day. When I went to the shop and they 
asked me how old I was, I felt confused. A few times they didn''t allow me to buy my 
groceries because it wasn''t the right time for me to be in the shop '' because I''m in the 
elderly group. This is ''fake care'', I think, and I don''t see it as an effective measure.  
 
The pandemic has an effect on our connections within the family too. My daughter has 
two daughters with whom I love spending time. Now I see my grandchildren less and 
less often also because they go to school, and with my husband, we take care that we 
don'' t get sick from them. This is really unpleasant. My daughter also is afraid that the 
kids may infect us; she would feel responsible for us if that would happen.  
 
I had some worries about getting vaccinated, but finally I did, in order to be able to 
participate in cultural events. It was very confusing '' everything around the vaccines '' 
because even though I''m vaccinated, I can still transfer the virus to other peop le. So the 
question of personal responsibility is a big one. I think that in the whole pandemic, there 
is a lot of manipulation '' and pushing us to greater isolation that serves certain interest. '''","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",1,"I was, I felt confused"
United States,"''I''m 32 years old and I''m from Dimitrovgrad. For the last 14 years, I''ve been 
living in Sofia. I finished my university education in Sofia. I''m working in the IT sector. I''m 
now living with my new boyfriend after the toxic relationship that I ended during the 
pandemic lockdown. The rest of my family consists of my parents and my brother, but I 
don''t live with them.  
 
Exactly during the pandemic, or worsened by it, I had a very bad emotional experience 
in the relationship I was in. I was in a toxic and somewhat violent relationship for a long 
time before the pandemic started. We met at my previous workplace,  and we spent 5 
years together. When the pandemic hit and we were locked inside one apartment all the 
time, the relationship, which was already bad, got much worse. The first months of the 
lockdown were somehow bearable, but later the tension became worse.  All side fa ctors 
that distracted both of us disappeared - we couldn't even go to the office. We were stuck 
together at home, with both of us working from home. We couldn't even go to the shop. 
We were 24/7 at home, locked from the rest of the world. The only thing th at exists for 
you at this moment is the person next to you. When he is abusive and he doesn''t have 
something on the side to put his anger on, he puts it on you '' in my case verbally, luckily, 
and not physically.  
 
While our situation was not rosy before that, the lockdown was a very serious factor in 
worsening it. The news scared  us every day about the virus,  and this is a lot of pressure 
even if the relationship is going  well. But when you have a violent partner, he puts it all 
only on you because you''re the only person in front of his eyes. Before the pandemic, 
when he could go to work and see his family and friends, he could put his violence and 
aggression  on them. Instead of shouting at me, he was doing this at h is parents,  and I 
was happy,  at least it was not me. It was a pause for me. But as said, during the lockdown, 
this was not possible. No way to go out and get distracted. I felt like I was in a prison 
inside my home.  
 
I wasn''t financially dependent on him, luckily. But I was dependent on him because we 
lived together in his flat. He knew it very well and made me as dependent as he could. 
During the pandemic, he wanted us to live in his house outside the city. I was full y 
isolated from people. When I finally gathered strength to leave him, I had to come up 
with reasons to go back to Sofia to pick up my stuff and run away.  
 
Regarding work, I didn''t lose my job, as it didn''t depend on the location we were working 
at, so I could continue working online. I even managed to find a better job.  
When I changed my job and started earning more money, actually, I got the extra power 
 
 
   53 
 
to leave the relationship.  
 
Long before the pandemic, he started manipulating me not to communicate with my 
mother and brother and with my friends. So when the pandemic hit and the hotels were 
closed, I barely had any contacts, plus even the few friends that I had left wouldn''t host 
me in their places because they were scared from the virus. So I felt I had no place to run 
to, no safe spot. I had to persuade myself that despite these conditions, I have to gather 
strength and leave anyway.  
 
The pandemic, in fact, sped up the process of our breakup. I knew something was off 
from the first weeks of our relationship. But I thought it could be fixed. With the 
lockdown, the relationship became so horrible that it motivated me to leave. I could 
finally see that this is truly wrong, that I shouldn''t bear all of this, not even a part of it. 
Towards the end of our relationship, he was regularly swearing and shouting at me, 
threatening to beat me up, throwing objects at me. I left in the beginning of 20 21, so I 
spent almost a year in this hell. I was lucky not to have a child with him. One day, I called 
my mother. I hadn''t talked to her for a year and a half. I just called her and told her, I''m 
coming back to you. She had no idea what was going on before  that.  
 
Regarding the rest of my family and the pandemic, I was scared for my mother because 
of the virus. She is a schoolteacher  and she''s elderly. I was worried that she could get 
infected at work. When I went back to Dimitrovgrad where she lives, I started helping 
her out in everyday life. I spent a few months with her there during which she went back 
to work in the school after months of teaching online. I decided to get vaccinated 
because of her '' to protect her. Even though she was hesitant, I managed to pers uade 
her to do it too;  
 
Nowadays, I can say I have a happy ending to the story. With my new partner, we got 
Covid  at the same time and we spent the quarantine together. Instead of fighting and 
shouting, this was an experience in which we helped and supported each other. '''","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",0,I felt I had no place to
United States,"''I''m a 34 -year -old woman from Sofia. I studied and lived in England for a long 
time, but I returned to Bulgaria 6 years ago. I have lived alone in a rented apartment 
since then. My parents live in Sofia also. I have an elder sister who is married and has tw o 
children - they also live nearby. I''m a healthcare practitioner with my own practice.  
 
Just before the pandemic started, I had started a new relationship with a woman. It was 
going well, but the new circumstances put a lot of strain on the relationship. We couldn''t 
date, so we could meet only at home. All other social contacts were limited b ecause of 
the lockdown, so we ended up spending a lot of time only together. I celebrated my 
birthday at home, only with her, just 10 days after meeting her. This made the 
relationship very intense, and it was specific. On one hand, it was great to have a close 
human being next to me during this challenging period. At the same time, there was a 
lot of demand. Somehow,  she had to meet all my normal social needs '' communication 
with friends and relatives whom I wasn''t meeting at that time. Lesbians anyway have the 
tendency to get very close very quickly and even to move in together soon after they 
start dating. The pande mic intensified things even more, which probably also caused 
our relationship to end rather quickly afterwards.  
 
In terms of my work situation, it wasn''t very rosy at the start of the pandemic. As a self -
employed health practitioner, the lockdown caused a lot of uncertainty. I experienced 
strong anxiety and stress about the future of my work and my financial situatio n. I have 
constant expenses every month that I have to cover, while my income is proportionally 
related to the number of the patients that I treat. When the pandemic started, in the 
unclear and chaotic situation, I had to take out a loan because my income stopped. I had 
to close the practice temporarily because there were no clear regulations about my 
profession and whether I could continue working. There were no hygienic supplies on 
the market too '' like sanitizers and masks. From this point onward, a lot of my patients 
stopped their treatments because they were worried about the virus. Obviously, this led 
to even more financial insecurity and anxiety about my professional prospects. Once we 
got into the routine of disinfection, my work continued almost nor mally, only that I had 
to comply with stronger hygiene measures. My schedule since the pandemic started 
changes very often. I have a lot of last -minute cancellations because people get ill with 
 
 
   56 
 
Covid  or are contact persons of other ill people, etc.  
 
As my parents are in a risk group because they are elderly, my biggest anxiety was 
actually for them. I was really worried that they may get ill, go to hospital or just die. As 
the daughter who is not yet married, I felt I have a bigger responsibility towa rds them 
than my married sister, who has a family of her own. To protect them, I avoided going to 
their place. We didn''t see each other properly for a long time. We met only in the park 
once in a while during the whole 2020. We got together on Easter in 20 21 only after my 
parents had gotten vaccinated. In the meantime, my sister and her family didn''t want to 
meet anyone. They stayed mostly at home and didn''t even go to the shop because they 
were scared about the virus. They ordered food to be delivered to t heir door and 
disinfected everything. I think the stress from the situation was getting to all of us. It was 
a difficult period, but I was happy we could still communicate and see each other from 
time to time.  
 
Despite all the worries and the social isolation, I still continued to take good care of 
myself '' I did sports, kept in touch with friends and even met with some of them, and so 
on. I had a very strong anxiety about the state of the world before the pandem ic '' but 
after the pandemic, the anxieties became so many and so strong that I just had to drop 
them all. I reached a high peak in anxieties and now I''m actually a bit calmer because I 
know I have no control over such large -scale phenomena. The world has i ts course and 
me worrying about it is not going to help. '''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,was really worried that they may get
Bulgaria,"''I am a 34 -year -old woman from Syria. I had lived there my whole life. But 
when my husband was killed in the war in Syria, I had no choice but to flee with my 
children. That''s why I came to Bulgaria four years ago. Here I work in the 
telecommunications fiel d, with my knowledge of Arabic and Turkish. I have three 
children and I live with them in Sofia '' a 13 -year -old daughter, 11 -year -old son, and 8 -
year -old son. They go to school here and they speak Bulgarian very well.  
 
In the beginning of the pandemic and the lockdown in Bulgaria, I lost my job, as many 
other people did. The situation was very bad for me and my children. I couldn't secure 
food for them; it was really tough because they rely only on me. I received very li ttle food 
aid, almost negligible. I didn't take any loans but just lived with whatever I had. I was 
without work for six months. I have a brother and sister in Germany, but they live on state 
aid, so they couldn''t help me financially.  
 
After these six months, I managed to find a new job, luckily. It is in telecommunications, 
as I speak Arabic and Turkish. I started working very hard in order to make ends meet. 
Because of the nature of my job, I can''t work remotely. I always have to be in  the office. 
So even in the highest peaks of the pandemic, I have been going to the office just 
because I had to keep my job and only  finances. I was scared that I might get ill '' but I 
had no choice. I was also worried about what will happen if I do, what  if my children get 
ill too, and who will take care of them if something happens to me. But I kept going to 
work, taking a lot of care to stay healthy, because I needed money.  
 
My children also had a lot of difficulties during the pandemic. They had to sit at home 
for more than a year because their education was online most of the time. It was tough 
for them and for me. They were studying at home but I couldn''t help them much bec ause 
they study in Bulgarian,  and I don''t know the language so well yet. They were getting 
behind with the school material sometimes. Also, it was so bad for them to stay inside all 
the time. They couldn''t play and meet other children, socialize with their  peers. They 
really needed other activities besides studying because they are kids. They were 
suffering a lot from this.  
 
As for the pandemic itself, I was very scared of the virus at the start of the whole thing, 
both for myself and for my children. I am very thankful to God that it is no longer like this. 
I didn't get vaccinated because I'm very afraid of it also. I knew ev en before how hard it 
is to live in Bulgaria, but I couldn't get out of here and I was just working to be what I 
should be. But during the pandemic, I realized how bad it is to be in Bulgaria as a refugee 
because I simply do not receive any support, as is the case in other European countries. 
Now my children are going to school, but without any other activities that a child needs. 
It is very difficult here in Bulgaria. So I hope that I can find a place that can provide 
support and care for my children. At t he same time, I did not feel discriminated against 
by the regular people.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,was also worried about what will happen

My daughter is 22 years old and my son is 12 years old. My daughter is about to have a 
child now and she lives separately with her husband. I live with my husband and my son 
in a rented flat. I work as a cleaning lady for private clients. I have had stable clients for 
many years, so my work is usually quite alright.  
 
The pandemic had a very negative effect on my work, however. When the lockdown was 
announced, I lost all of my work because my clients were afraid of the virus. Nobody 
wanted outside people coming into their homes. Even though they knew me well, 
people wer e scared because of all the horrible things they saw and heard on TV. My 
income is month for month, so I was left without money. My husband kept his job, so we 
managed to survive, but it was difficult. We also couldn''t help my elder daughter with 
financial  support.   
 
The other really difficult thing for our family was my son not going to school. It was very 
tough for him. He had to stay at home all the time. He had difficulties with studying 
because everything was online. We had to quickly find a computer for him to us e so he 
could study. But it was still not the same and he was upset. I had to help my son with his 
classes instead of his teachers. It was stressful for him and for me too. I was very worried 
that he would get very much behind his peers, but also maybe the y didn''t find it so easy 
to study online either. The teachers were not very helpful, they didn''t know how to use 
the new technology so much. They were also stressed,  probably from the virus and 
everything that was going on. So I had to learn the material that my son had to learn, so 
I could pass it on to him as well as I could.  
 
The whole time I was not only worried about money and for my children, but I was also 
very scared of the virus, mostly for my family. I didn''t want my husband and my children 
to get ill. The same goes  for my elderly parents who live alone in another city. I didn''t 
know what would happen. When the hospitals were full, I was only imagining how 
horrible it would be if one of us was so ill to need a hospital. It would have been hell. I''m 
very grateful that  none of us needed this.  
 
The other unpleasant thing for me was that I was also stuck at home,  which is very strange 
for me. I''m usually going around all the time , working at different houses and meeting 
people constantly. I''m very sociable  and outgoing. And now I had to be in my apartment 
all the time, like a prisoner. Some people like staying at home, I also do, but not all the 
time. I needed to sociali se more,  and this was difficult for me, to be so closed. '''

stayed because I made really good friends,  and I could not leave the island. Mainly I 
stayed because I fell in love. I have one brother and my mother. Last year, a couple of 
months before the covid situation started, my father passed away in Greece. I went to 
the funeral. Thank God my brother was there for my mother and the funeral 
arrangem ents. I was away I did not see my father before that,  and I could not help my 
mother. Even if I were in Greece,  I don't think I could be around my mother a lot. I love 
her but we get on each other's nerves.  
 
I work at a semi -government organisation in a low paid position,  but I am happy. I do not 
ask for much money. My girlfriend and I live in a rented house with our cat, and we just 
need to have each other and be healthy. I studied economics and finance. However,  I 
work as an administrative officer.  
 
The lock down... well I loved the lockdown phase. I could avoid seeing people that I 
didn't want to see, I lost weight because I cooked and exercised, I had the time to wash 
my curtains and clean the house in places that I never knew existed! I stayed at home 
and got paid for doing nothing, since my employer could not provide me with a way to 
telework. Things changed later  and we got laptops and access to the software to be able 
to work. Although the government issued measures for people who were at home an d 
could not work, i.e. to be paid 60% of their salary, my organisation never cut any money 
from my salary. I was lucky since I was not affected financially by government policies. 
Others were not. I have friends who could not work, because gyms were not op en and 
others who lost their jobs.  
 
One thing that made my life difficult  is that I cannot travel. I cannot go home. I love 
Cyprus and I chose to live here, but I miss my family in Greece. I miss travelling and being 
able to be there for my loved ones. I hate feeling uncertain. I don't want to fly home and 
be forced to stay at a hotel for 7 days or more. I do not have so much annual leave 
available. And my mother, I cannot force her to stay in one place. She is old and 
vulnerable, but she wants to go to church to see people. With the new Covi d mutation, 
I am scared. It is so easy to contaminate another person. Let's not lie to ourselves. In a 
plane people do not keep their distance . If one person has covid, the whole plane will 
be sick. You wear your mask but at some point,  you will eat and drink. This augments the 
risk, and I cannot risk my vulnerable mother's health.  
 
On a psychological level, at first it was ok, it was something new, exciting, I felt that they

United Kingdom,"''I am 66 years old, and I am retired. However, I still work in the fields 
exercising my passion with fruit cultivation (oranges, grapefruit, mandoras ). I am happily 
married with 3 children. Two of my children live abroad and one lives in Cyprus.  
 
Covid was very restrictive in my lifestyle. Life was very different than it was in the past. 
During the lockdowns and now I could not do any of my extra -curricular  activities, I could 
not see friends, family, I couldn't travel. I feel that it was not a tragic situation for me. But 
I stopped going to the gym and now I am afraid to go back because of the covid 
situation. Due to that I gained weight which may have a ne gative result on my health.  
I was, however,  lucky because I had my field as an escape when I could not see my friends 
and family. I do not feel that I was psychologically affected. Nevertheless, the restrictive 
measures were a great challenge to me and my family. I felt bad  because I could not see 
my mother and father who are vulnerable and old. I wish I could see them more often. 
Moreover, another time where I felt stress was when my 87-year -old father became sick 
with covid -19. I honestly thought that he would not make it. He got si ck at a retirement 
home. We knew that retirement homes in France were having trouble in 2019. Instead 
of benchmarking and thinking of ways to avoid this situation, we had to experience the 
same situation in 2020. My father got sick because the government d id not take the 
correct steps.  
 
Another problem for me was that I could not visit my 2 children who live abroad.  
In March 2019 when the covid -19 situation started in Cyprus, I was travelling from 
Australia where my family and I went to visit my son. Travelling was difficult at the time 
because of the uncertainty related to covid -19. I had a bad experience with delays  at 
Qatar where I had my transit flight coming back home. Once in Cyprus my family and I 
had to remain at home restriction. At the same time I had a great fear because there was 
uncertainty about the seriousness of covid -19. I was scared because there was no cure 
and being a covid -19 patient was considered more serious for people over 65. I was not 
65 at the time but I was close so I felt scared when I heard that people of my age were 
dying. I was wearing gloves, masks, I had to take extra precautions that made my life 
unnecessarily complicated. Things changed when scientists discovered more about 
covid -19. Later on, during 2021 Christmas holidays, my son came for a visit from the UK 
and a couple of days later he became sick with covid -19. Fortunately, he had no 
symptoms,  but I felt trapped and unable to fully express my love. I had to cancel the New 
Years eve party that I always organise for the past 20 years and spend dinner with only 5 
family members instead of 30+.  
 
Generally I believe the government initially had taken reasonable measures but then it 
did not take enough precautionary measures. The government could have seen what 
was first going on in other EU countries and adopted  similar measures instead of waiting 
for people to die first. I believe that my attitude was positive,  and I followed the rules for 
my protection and for the society's protection, This made me see the situation with 
humour instead of feeling pressured. I stayed home and dined at my wife's '''re staurant''.  
 
Now the main problem we face as a family is the continuous increase in necessary goods 
prices. Generally,  I feel that after covid -19 we as citizens have to pay a lot and I am also 
going to pay. I am sure there was a lot of waste.   
 
Finally,  I feel that I lost some years of my life. When a person is retired, one wants to travel 
and enjoy life. Due to covid -19 I lost that opportunity and I feel that I wasted some years 
of my life. I feel my years are wasted because if covid -19 was a real threa t to humanity, 
then states would stop wars, fighting and generally political unrest. On the contrary they 
are using this illness as an excuse to gain influence and earn money.''",['Domestic'],0,"humanity, then states would stop wars, fighting"
China,"''I am Chinese born and raised in China and currently I am 30 years old and 
living in Cyprus with my wife. She is Cypriot. I am an only child. In China we are all only 
children. I have the responsibility to carry on the family name. My family lives in China . I 
am an architect. I studied in China and France. I speak Chinese, French and English. I am 
 
 
      
 
learning Greek now in order to get A2 level and be able to apply for my architect license . 
My learning process is slow.  
In 2019 I was in China when covid -19 started, close to my hometown . I was planning to 
come to Cyprus and reunite with my girlfriend who was already here, in February 2020 
after the Chinese New Year  celebrations. When covid -19 broke we didn't know how 
serious it would get, until people started dying. People started panicking when we lost 
food and medical supplies. The government started preparing. We had lockdowns. At 
the moment since I was planning to come to Cyprus,  I quit my job, so I was unemployed. 
I was between jobs because I left my current job to start my life in Cyprus. I tried to work 
a bit online but I had no income. I didn't start job hunting because I didn't know how 
long it would last and when I was going to be able to come to Cyprus. Uncertaint y was 
the worse part of my experience.  
 
I did not get infected with covid -19, but I know a lot of people who did. In China people 
with covid -19 because homeless because they would leave their homes to keep other 
family members safe, they had nowhere to go at the beginning and they slept in parking 
places. Some of them died because there were not enough beds in hospitals.  
 
It took me 8 months to come to Cyprus. The normal way to apply for a visa was not 
available for tourist and working visa. I tried to get a work visa but got rejected without 
a main justification. So my wife's family had to use special resources to get me a  visa. I 
had to do something that I was not comfortable with. I hate using corruption,  but it was 
the only way to come to Cyprus. Once in Cyprus, I stayed with family. It is hard for me to 
meet new people and make friends. During the lockdowns I learned Gr eek on my own,  
but it is hard. My wedding happened during the lockdown with only 20 people,  and it 
was not ceremonial. It was mostly administrative. I couldn't get married at church 
because I am not Christian Orthodox.  
 
Making contrasts between the Cypriot government and the Chinese government, I see 
that in China the government used technology very effectively for applications. Back 
home we minimise physical contact because we are millions,  so people are used to 
avoiding contact. here in Cyprus people like the physical contact. When they want 
something from the government they like to go and wait in queues. During covid -19 I 
see a lot of change here in Cyprus. It started to become more effic ient like in China. 
Things chan ged with the Land Registry, food deliveries and government applications.  
My situation is special. I came with a special visa and then I married a Cypriot. When I 
got married,  I got a temporary family reunification visa. I also applied for a permanent 
visa. The government Immigration department made a mistake with my address when 
they send the reply. It took me 6 months to discover the mistake and why my visa was 
not issued. I am not even sure I am residing in Cyprus legally at the moment. For example 
I want to take my driving license  here in Cyprus and work legally but I cannot do it. The 
immigration department is very slow. I cannot go back to my country and see my family, 
because I don't know if I can leave the country or come back. Due to the inefficiency of 
the Immigration Department,  I cannot travel or work. It has been a year since I applied. I 
had to go there in person to find out what happened. Now that the situation is clear I 
 hope I will get my visa soon to stay with my family legally. My situation means I could not 
apply for any support scheme during covid -19. Even psychologically I am worried. I can't 
do anything on my own. I cannot have electricity in my name, I cannot register for the 
National Health System GESY. I am patient and I feel supported by my family here . I feel 
I have to rely on other people all the time. I even had to use acquaintances to open a 
bank account.  
 
I didn't feel racism either because I am from China (where covid -19 started) or because 
I am a foreigner here in Cyprus. I know that in other EU countries people are being racist 
to Chinese people. Here in Cyprus measures are generally not so strict. Back home we 
all abide by the law very strictly. I am not vaccinated. I am not against vaccination. Most 
possibly I would be vaccinated if I were in China. In Cyprus one can chose to be 
unvaccinated since there is no wide use of public transportation, you can g o anywhere 
with your car. It is annoying to do a rapid test every 48 hours. I did not get vaccinated 
because of family influence. I don't feel they would reject me if I got vaccinated but I feel 
they would worry for me. Being unvaccinated here in Cyprus is  inconvenient. I cannot go 
for a drink or to a restaurant, I can''t  go to events with my job. I feel discriminated against 
because of my vaccination status it is not inclusive. It is hard. I feel there is a continuous 
argument between vaccinated and unvacci nated people. I am sick and tired of this 
discussion and generally talking about covid -19. It is not the virus itself but the 
psychological dividing of people. The virus treatment is artificial.  
 
I am in contact with a Chinese community here in Cyprus and I an find out how to get 
vaccinated If I want to get vaccinated. I am not registered with a GESY doctor yet because 
I do not have permanent  immigration status.  
 
A positive observation is when I first applied for a visa, I had to wait in a long queue. This 
year, I did a reservation,  and my appointment was at a specific time. it was much more 
organised. I was really frustrated by the Immigration department mistake so the fact that 
I didn't have to wait made things a bit better.","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",0,in Cyprus and I an find out
United States,"''I am 34 years old, single and I have a sister and a father. My mother died 5 
years ago from cancer. I am single for the last 7 years. I have a good job, but I am always 
looking for something new.  
 
During the covid -19 situation I felt stressed. Not for me but for my father. My father 
retired and he had a lot of health problems. He started being forgetful. I was worried for 
the economic issues. My father was in charge of my mothers' estate after her d eath, but 
he was not able to make choices. I was worried about  my mother's estate and for the 
money he got due to his retirement. I had to take him to the banks and settle the financial 
issues with him. I was scared due to the previous economic recession o f 2013 where the 
Cyprus government decided to close Laiki bank and account holders who had more than 
100.000 euros lost their money for the banking system to survive. I was worried that due 
to covid -19 my family might have a cash problem. Once I realised t hat this crisis was 
different,  I felt a bit better. I am scared for the economy of our generation and due to 
covid -19 because of the non -sustainable population situation.  
 
My father is my main concern since March 2019. He used to be a casualties doctor but 
he always had health problems. He had a bad life. He smoked , he never exercised, he 
had heart attacks when I was at primary school. I was always afraid that something bad 
would happen to him suddenly. I have experienced  sudden loss. He was very private. 
He never talked to us. I felt that when my mother died in 2017 he became more 
vulnerable. He had a minor stroke in   9 and in 2017 when my mother died he started 
getting wo rse. At 72 he stopped taking care of himself. He did nothing to help himself. 
He had a problem with his prostate,  and he had an impaired nervous and vascular 
system in 2018. In 2019 he had another stroke. I took him to the beach to help him. In 
November 2019 I moved to the capital for work (my hometown is not the capital). I would 
come home every weekend. He got worse day by day. My sister never visited our 
hometown at the time. So, I felt that I was the sole person responsible  for my father. At 
the beginni ng of 2020 my father drove his car. One day when I came to my hometown I 
asked where the car was,  and he said he had a small accident. At some point during the 
lockdown,  they closed access to my hometown,  so I had to get special  permission to go 
visit my father and look after him. One time I did not visit for a month. He said he was ok 
but I knew it was not true. I called the car shop and found out his car accident was not 
small. His car was a total  loss. We discussed with my sister and decided to sell my father's 
car and take his driving license from him. He lived alone at home. He could not get used 
to it. He did not eat healthy food. My sister made food for him , different food for every 
day because he didn't like to eat the same. She also lived in another town. She froze the 
food in tappers,  and we bought a microwave for him to defrost it and heat eat up. We 
tried to help him eat healthy, but he wanted to eat junk food and chocolate. He asked 
for help from the neighbors . 
  
Covid -19 made it difficult for my to take care of my father the way I wanted to. I could 
not go to my hometown as much as I wanted to. In October 2020 my father had to 
undergo an operation. He could not move or stay on his own. We searched for a carer,  
but covid -19 made it very difficult to find a carer. We searched for retirement homes. I 
had to look after my health at the moment due to an injury,  but I sacrificed my health and 
decided to look after my father. I did not go to the physiotherapist  I needed t o go to in 
order to avoid risk of covid -19 infection so that I could see my father.  
At the beginning of 2021, the covid -19 incidents were on the rise,  and we could not visit 
my father at the retirement home. For the past years my father encapsulated the word 
problem in my life. I feel worried and depressed.''","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",0,f 2013 where the Cyprus government decided
United States,"''I am turning 65 years old soon and I live with my 70 year old husband. I have 
four children who are over 18. They all live on their own. One of them is married, the 
other recently engaged and my daughters are also independent living on their own. My 
younger one lives in the UK and studies. When covid -19 appeared in Cyprus I worked at 
my towns' hospital in the pathology ward. Not only did I have to treat and witness first 
hand incidents of covid pa tients but I also treated and tread patients who suffer from the 
vaccines' effects. I believe covid existed since centuries. They are trying to create a 
pandemic since 2011. Big pharmaceutical companies are trying to become millionaires.  
When I was infected with covid -19, the worst memory I have is my psychological state. I 
was locked in a white room all alone all day long and people with astronaut uniforms 
would come to give me food and measure my vital signs. I was panicked by the media.  
They are at fault they made us feel so bad, they were bullying us into being careful to 
serve the government's interests.  
 
I was one of the first covid -19 patients in Cyprus. I talked to journalists and they wrote an 
article about me. They took me to the specialised hospital in Masochists. I think it was 
not really necessary. My husband is a cancer patient. We lived together a nd we were 
very lucky he did not get sick. We were careful when I was at home. I had fever, I lost my 
appetite and smell, I was stressed all the time and got diabetes. When it was my time to 
leave, they tested me again and again and the tests where once po sitive and once 
negative. I had to do 7 PCR tests. A positive note was that I lost weight because I had to 
be on diet. I lost 15 kilos. I was provided help by a psychologist and medicine. I feel that 
it did not help me. I can only get better when the problem goes away. At that time, I was 
alone for 20 days now they say covid -19 only needs 8 days to stop being contagious. I 
advise everyone to stop watching the news. They are harmful they make you believe 
what they want.   
 
I disagree with the measures. They only decide this way due to their interests. Nurses 
have to be back to work after being sick with covid -19 in 8 days but they cannot go to 
the supermarket to do their groceries! This is absurd.  
 
I work for the government so we were ok financially. In my town the Municipality took 
food to some people who were restricted in their houses, but they did not take care of 
me. I always wondered who helps the ones who have no children.  
In my opinion the measures were insufficient. The Ministry of Health is at fault. There was 
not correct management of the situation. In my hospital we had 3 patients with 
symptoms. I told them to test them and they did not believe me. They accused the 
Engl ish man and his relatives who came from the UK as the ones who spread covid -19 
in my town but I know it was another patient.  
 
Concerning vaccines, I know that people got thrombosis and other symptoms from 
them. I now that both vaccinated and unvaccinated people may get sick heavily from 
covid -19. I believe they do not protect enough. if they protected why do we have to do 
it ever y 5-6 months? Why is it in Greece and Cyprus they say we have to do another shot 
so early and in other EU countries not? Economic interests. I got the vaccine because I 
was forced. I did not do it until they forced us to test every 48 hours. If it were eve ry 72 
hours I would continue to test myself. I did the Johnson vaccine to get over with it. I feel 
they lie to us. They created hatred amongst people the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.  
 
I am stressed as a woman, as a nurse, as a mother. The private sector has no business. 
My husband works in the tourist sector . He  sells leather goods,  and he was heavily 
affected by the situation. At least I work in the government. what about families who are 
 
 
   68 
 
both in the private sector or who lost their jobs? The prices go up, bread, milk, petrol 
but our salaries no. I feel stressed because the real crisis will follow and we will have no 
food on our table. I am stressed for my children because they got vaccinated. I am scared 
that I will not become a grandmother. Our life will never be the same,  we will never get 
it back. It is a scam. 60% is already vaccinated but nothing is really changing.''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,alone for 20 days now they say

years ago. I am not in a relationship for the last 6 years. I have a good job, but I am always 
looking for something new.  
During the covid -19 situation I felt affected. I am one of those people who are deeply 
affected when their exercise and eating routine changes. The lockdown affected me in 
a negative manner psychologically. I feel depressed. At the end of 2020 I had an 
accident with my shoulder. Until March 2020 it was improved and I could go to the gym 
again. I was getting ready to go to a scuba diving trip with a friend. However at that time 
the first covid -19 patient was found in Cyprus and we had to cancel since the fir st 
lockdown in Cyprus was decided. I felt stressed. Not for the trip. During the first 
lockdowns our movements were controlled. We had to send a text message to circulate 
and the police would stop us and ask to see the SMS and our identity cards. I felt 
controlled. I had to reduce my movements to 2 per day. I liked it because I could stay 
home without feeling guilty. I feel guilty when I do nothing. I don't like wasting my time. 
During the lockdowns I felt nice with myself because I could not do anything an yway. I 
felt constrained. It was nice and scary that there was no people in the streets. During the 
first lockdown I was not alone, I had a flatmate. It was bearable. It felt earing, scary and 
captivating, it felt paranormal but not supernatural it was sur real.  
I went to the gym when the gyms were not forced to close. I enjoyed the lack of traffic 
and teleworking when it was available for other people. I cannot telework due to my job. 
The government made the right decisions at first taking into account the availa ble facts. 
People used to respect the decisions at first. Then they stopped. At first they obeyed 
because of fear of the unknown. I was also responsive. Now that we know what covid -19 
 
 
is all about we see that the first government decisions may have been wrong. Then they 
were right for the risk management.  
During summer 2020, things were almost normal again. I decided to do an operation for 
my shoulder. I did the operation in Fall 2020. I did it before the situation got worse but I 
was alone due to restrictions. Recovery was bad the following year. I could n ot exercise 
or swim. I could do nothing. I could only go for a walk.  
At the beginning of 2020 I wanted to try to start a relationship. I wanted to start dating 
again to meet a girl to give it a shot. I wanted something that would last. I decided to be 
active in that domain but until 2022 I did not have much choice to meet p eople due to 
the lockdowns. I tried to date during summertime  but it was devastating  from the covid -
19 situation before it even started. Sometimes I ask myself  if it weren't for covid -19 would 
I still be alone now? Possibly not. At least I would have some experience. On the other 
hand I feel it is less unnatural not to look for a girl. After my brake up in 2016, I always 
had an issue with girls. I felt I was not very good at the dating sport and covid -19 made 
me feel relaxed about it so I did not try to get  better. After covid -19 it is more difficult to 
meet people and feel comfortable with them. My social life is affected. I don't flirt or go 
out. I became friends with the mask, I avoid handshakes , I watch movies where people 
do not wear a mask and wonder w hy. Covid -19 is unnatural it is still not history. We still 
live it and it develops. I am excited by the fact of covid -19 existence and that generations 
after us will be studying us in search like this one.  
 
I was disappointed by the general population in Cyprus due to their inability to follow 
rules and their lack of knowledge or half -knowledge. They read an article and think they 
have become  experts. Especially our generation that has experienced no war like our 
parents did. We were brought up to feel exceptional '''snowflakes''. I believe general rules 
must be enforced and the majority of people will follow. The other approach would be 
to let o nly the strong ones survive. Governments are not Gods. People are co mplaining 
in general. The Cypriot Government (with the exception of the first lockdown) observed 
their political loss and gain and acted accordingly. I do not believe they saw the health 
needs of people. In March 2020, the measures were decided for the peo ple. In 
November, the measures were decided for the president's re -election.  
 
Covid -19 exposes the worse and the bad behaviours of people everywhere. On TV in 
the streets. When a virous with a low mortality had this adverse effect, imagine what 
would happen in a much worse situation. The lack of preparation especially with 
retiremen t homes was inexcusable. We saw what happened in other countries but 
Cyprus did not follow the benchmarks to help the elderly. I felt our politicians where 
ruthless in the sense of using covid -19 as an excuse to pass their own messages. I believe 
covid -19 will soon become a regular seasonal disease like flu. Unfortunately people are 
suspicious they don't understand that vaccines are now created much faster than before 
due to better resources.  
 
I miss some aspects of covid -19 lockdowns. I miss seeing my friends in their houses 
(since we could not go out). Now this stopped they went back to their normal lives that 
do not include our game nights at home.   '''

United States,"''I am 49 years old, married with 3 children aged 11, 13 and 14 years old. I 
am an art teacher at a gymnasium and a lyceum. Covid -19 was a great period to get to 
know oneself, to spend quality time with the family during the lockdowns. I didn't mind 
the loc kdowns. I tried to see the positive side of the crisis. However it was too much for 
me personally since I am a teacher and I have 3 children at school. I worked too many 
hours to handle the new situation, to be there for my children and my students, to cre ate 
new material from scratch to do online courses. Art is not an easy subject to teach online. 
The Ministry of Education had no online teaching platform! For one month since the 
lockdowns started we had no means to continue teaching. The children lost tim e and 
valuable knowledge that year (2020). Once the Ministry of Education created the 
platform, we had no relevant training to learn how to teach online, how to engage with 
students. We had to have a camera on but the students were children so no cameras 
were allowed (GDPR). I never knew if my students were actually following the class or 
not. The last 2 years, the Ministry did not provide the right training tools to make our job 
efficient and to facilitate children. I still feel restricted. Even for teache rs who taught from 
school, things were not easy. Schools are not properly equipped for teaching during 
covid -19. For art classes, we lacked drawing material, at school the computers did not 
 
 
     
 
have a camera or a microphone. I tried to connect my personal laptop and I could not 
do it. There were technical difficulties.  
 
As a woman and a mother, I felt that I had to carry a lot of weight. I worked from home 
during the lockdowns and had to take care of the children and my husband had to work. 
He administers a canteen he is a chef in the private sector. It was very hard. We had to 
operate four laptops, we had internet problems because we have no land line. We had 
to pay extra for internet, so it was a n economic burden as well. I worked day and night 
during the lockdown. I worked until 3 o'clock in the morning some days to be  able to 
cope and I had to wake up at 6 to prepare the children for their day. I didn't mind the 
government measures and policies because I had no time to follow them, I had no time 
to go out. My husband went to the supermarket since he went to work.  
My man problem was with children vaccination. I am vaccinated with 3 doses. The 2 
vaccines had a nasty effect on me especially the 3rd dose. When the government tried 
to force us to vaccinate our children, I felt discriminated against. Not because of all t he 
restrictive measures unvaccinated people have to take but due to the fact that the 
government tried to remove all responsibility from vaccine side effects from itself and 
made us sign that we consent for our underaged children to be vaccinated and that we 
as parents bare all responsibility if we accept. Of course all my children are not 
vaccinated. I never had to sign for other vaccines my children got. I am not against 
vaccines. I am against the way the government tried to alleviate its legal responsibi lity 
and pin it on parents who are not experts or doctors. I don't feel comfortable with side 
effects that my children may have in 50 years from now.  
 
Concerning the economic side, we are relatively lucky. I work in the public sector and 
my husband was affected but not heavily. What I see now however is the prices of basic 
goods on the rise. Our salaries do not rise and sometimes it is difficult to go th rough the 
month with our income. My husband ''s job at the canteen was affected because people 
work from home so they do not order as much.  
 
During the lockdowns and the covid -19 situation I had to undergo an operation. 
Although the hospital staff was really helpful and nice, I felt alone. I was alone when I 
went to the hospital. I was alone when I woke up after the anesthesia . I had no visitors 
and no moral support from my family. At some point after my operation when I had to 
visit the ER, the people around me were found covid -19 positive. I was scared for the 
unknown.  
 
In April 2021 my husband got covid -19. We had to restrict him in one room. he couldn't 
bare it. Thankfully we did not contract the virus and he did not have serious side -effects.  
 
Recently my son and younger daughter were found covid -19 positive. The had a but of 
fever and some coughing. Again we managed to seclude them in their rooms, but it was 
difficult. My son was very creative during his restriction. he created games and art. H e 
had to read by himself since his teacher at school did not do the classes online. My 
daughter was a bit more difficult she had online classes and she spend her time reading  
 
books and cleaning her room. She was bored and ate all the time. I had to run up and 
down the stairs all the time.  
 é
Concerning my extended family, my father is old, vulnerable and lives in a retirement 
home. To see him we have to book an appointment in advance and only 2 people are 
allowed. When I go with my children I have to choose. It is hard and not logical.  
I feel prejudice against people who are covid -19 positive or their contacts. There is 
discrimination and fear against them. I see it at school. I see it as a teacher. Now the rule 
is that if an unvaccinated person is a contact due to a school covid -19 posi tive person, 
they can come to school if they do a rapid test and it is negative. This is the new '''test -to-
stay'' rule. It is stupid. If my unvaccinated daughter is a contact at school,  she can go to 
school with a negative rapid test. If she is in contact wi th her brother at home she cannot. 
I am vaccinated so if I am a contact I go to work. When I took my daughter the other day 
to an after -school class, the manager told us she had to go and remain home because 
she was a contact of her siblings. This was so irr ational. The covid -19 stricken children 
were obligated to stay home for 10 days and she was forcing my daughter to stay home 
for 17 days according to her understanding of the protocol. The problem is that 
everyone explains the protocols as they see fit.''","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,I felt that I had to carry

pressure. I honestly never imagined that having children would be a nightmare for me. 
The most difficult task of my life. We tried naturally for a year and in 2019 I persuaded  
my husband to see a doctor. My gynecologist found that there was nothing wrong with 
me because she was clueless . My husband had a problem due to an injury he had when 
he was young. So we went to a fertility clinic right before the covid -19 break -out in 
Cyprus. We had our last happy trip in November 2019 and in December, we started IVF 
treatment. It was stressful, psychologically damaging an d nobody understood how I felt. 
My husband made me hide it so I could not talk to my sister or my best friend about it. I 
felt so alone, so secluded, I felt I was lying  whenever I smiled and said I was ok. My 
gynecologist provided no support. Not even after the first failure when I asked for her 
reference to receive the government aid. The process was very expensive, embarrassing  
and lonely because my husband felt that it was my duty to be at the clinic all the time 
and to take all those hormones and blow u p and feel depressed. I was not myself . I was 
somebody else. I felt that someone else was inside my body and my mind. I wanted to 
hurt myself. I wanted to run outside and shout how unfair that was for me. How some 
women had children and had abortions and others had them by accident. How some 
people have children and molest them or stop caring for them. I did everything right I 
was perfect, I was a good student, a good person, I did volunteering and donated money 
for the poor, I was thoughtful and caring wit h people around me.  But I could not find 
the support I needed because it was a secret I had to keep inside and hide my feelings. 
The first IVF failure was followed by the covid -19 lockdown. Not only had I have to get 
over my depression while lying  to everyone about it but I also had to change my lifestyle 
due to the lockdowns and restrictions in movements, gyms had to close so I could not 
exercise  I couldn ''t see friends and family. I had to pretend at work and I still feel weird 
when people ask me why I don't have children or if I have children or when they say they 
don''t want to stand in line to do rapid tests for their children or that their children 
consume their time. And I want to scream and tell them to shut up. To love their children 
and cheri sh them to be therefore  them because some of us cannot have children even if 
we love them so much. I changed my baby brother's  diapers  from the age of 10. l looked 
after my aunt's children and went to their birthday part ies to entertain the children . I 
teach at the university part -time because I feel that my students are the only children I 
have right now. I feel weird whenever a woman I know gets pregnant and when people 
say that covid -19 was the perfect time to start a family because couples had mo re time  
 
 
   75 
 
to create children during the lockdowns.   
I had to undergo two more IVFs during the covid lockdown. All unsuccessful. Every time 
it was a bit better than the last, but I felt that I was killing myself  for 2 months in order to 
try to create another life. I went to a psychologist during the covid -19 measures. I feel a 
bit better but not cured. It was required to try to express myself with a mask and not to 
see my psychologist's  expressions. I made her cry one time I think. She had a similar 
problem in her family she said. Tackling a taboo matter like  infertility is hard especially 
in Cyprus where everybody knows everybody. Handling it in a covid -19 situation where 
one is afraid to do the IVFs or seek  support and the right guidance is torture. I am getting 
older,  and my new gynecologist discovered I have an infertility problem too. I had to 
undergo another operation (hysteroscopy) a couple of months ago to  improve e my 
ability to have a baby. Being in a hospital during covid -19 is lonely and scary but the 
support was really good. Even after the operation I have no luck. My mother -in-law 
blames us for not going to church  regularly. Other people tell me that it is my fault 
because I work too much and because I am stressed. I postpone the new IVF, the last 
time I can receive 50% of the money from the govern ment because I am scared of failure. 
I feel responsible because I am the organised one and my husband is the cool f ollower. 
Covid -19 makes health problems even bigger than what they really are, especially 
concerning family creation for women. It is a discriminatory process all the way from the 
first test to the blood coming on the 14th day to signal the ne xt failure. I know that I am 
depressed and sad even if I pretend to be ok. Covid -19 makes things worse. I believe a 
miracle will happen when I least expect it. '''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",3,I feel weird whenever a woman I
United States,"''I am 65 years old, female, doctor and married in Cyprus with 3 children. I 
come from Cyprus from a v illage in Morphou and I have 8 siblings. 5 sisters and 2 
brothers. Covid -19 affected me in multiple  ways. I remember in 2020, around the end of 
March, my older sister had an accident. She injured her leg very badly. Fortunately she 
did not brake it but she needed immediate medical assistance. The accident happened 
during the 1st lockdown. Usually I run for help as I am the only sister who is a doctor and 
also a specialist dermatologist. However I could not attend to my sister and run for help 
because I was quarantined  due to travelling. I felt that my ability to help my loved ones 
was compromised due to covid -19 measures.  
 
After the lockdown when we were allowed to see patients, my sister was my first patient 
in April 2020. I was really intimidated  because she is vulnerable due to a health problem 
she has and because of the fear of the unknown  consequences  of covid -19 to older 
people at the beginning . Now I am not so worried but at the time I was scared just like 
everybody.  
 
Another issue that made me feel uncomfortable  was my fear to do covid -19 testing 
because I was afraid to contract the virus at the testing place. A doctor, it was very difficult 
for me to see my patients through Viber. I did not charge my patients and tried to help 
them through calling and talking on Viber. At the time, in 2020, I made my first steps into 
the National Health System (GESY) as a doctor so covid -19 was also a financial problem 
for me because (1) I could not practice medicine face -to-face with my patients at my 
practice and ( 2) I examined my patients online with the risk of making an incomplete 
diagnosis and I also did not get paid. On the other hand, I had to pay my taxes, social 
insurance and all o f the levies to the government but I could not benefit from the 
government measures and company/individual schemes, as I was '''working''. What I 
observed as a doctor from my patients, is that many of them developed psychological 
issues, including stress, depre ssion and they had to see a professional. Even young 
people. I feel lucky th at I had a place to escape. Technology was a very important feature 
of covid -19. I was forced to learn to use GESY system, zoom and other systems.  
 
Covid -19 was a darker period in my psychological status because I felt alone. I could not 
see my two children for a whole year, I didn't see my family and I reduced my activities.  
 
Fortu nately although my family is very big we did not have any loss from Covid. I was 
worried for my niece who is a f ront-line doctor who also administered PCR  tests at the 
hospital and she has 3 very young children. I was also worried for my daughter who is a 
doctor in Germany and worked at a hospital at the time with covid -19 patients. I am 
grateful that nothing happened to them. We were all very  careful.  
 
The positive side of covid -19 is that I live next to my order daughter and I did not feel so 
lonely. Also my husband and I have fields  with oranges and we could escape from 
everyday home -quarantine . I felt unco mfortable with one incident during the lockdown 
when we were forced to send text messages to go out from the house. We were allowed 
to send 2 SMS per day. We sent one SMS  to go to the fields to cut the oranges. We had 
 
 
   77 
 
to cut them alone since we had no ability or willingness to employee third parties due to 
covid -19. So we went in the morning and naturally this job lasted more than the 3 hours 
'''unwritten rule'' for each message. When we were returning home a police officer 
stopped our car and accused us of using the SMS  in the wrong way because he said that 
a whole day of work in the fie lds was not '''reasonable time''. We started arguing and 
shouting and this made my husband and I feel very bad. He did not impose a fine afte r 
all but we felt so bad that we would ask our children to walk the dog until the police 
check point to see if police was there when we were returning from our field work. I 
believe this is a grand obscurity and obstruction of our human right of free movemen t 
due to bad interpretation of government  measures.''","['Workplace', 'Healthcare']",0,I made my first steps into the
United States,"''I am 39 years old and a mom of three, my older son is nine years old, and I 
have twins who are six years old. We moved to the Czech Republic four years ago; my 
husband got a job here as a software engineer. I am originally from Russia, where I got 
my medic al degree. I was planning to continue my aesthetic medical practice in the 
Czech Republic, but I could not finish the so -called recognition of qualification process. 
One of my sons was hospitalized a day before my exam, but I was not allowed to  
reschedule it. So I got my business license and opened a cosmetic studio instead. We 
live in a mid -sized (70 000 inhabitants) city in the Central -Bohemian region.  
 
When the pandemic started, my friend and I joined the wave of volunteers sewing face 
cloth masks. The municipal office provided us with fabric, and the masks we sewed were 
later distributed by other volunteers in the retirement homes, schools, and other 
facilities. I found the handicraft to be a soothing exercise amidst this stressful period. 
Like many other services, I had to close down my salon for an extended period several 
times during the pandemic. Indeed, there were some financial compensations progra ms 
I applied for. I was able to pay the rent and buy some food with that, but that's it. Luckily, 
contrary to many other migrants in the Czech Republic, we are pretty financially secure. 
So this was not such an issue for us as my husband's job wasn't affec ted by the pandemic.  
 
Our family has a very good experience with our children's school '' both before and 
during the pandemic. One of our sons got an assistant helping him and a few other 
migrant and Roma children in his class with the schoolwork. She continued to meet with 
him during the school closure for online sessions. We could be involved in our children's 
education, but it was great to get additional support, especially with the Czech language 
classes. Overall we appreciate the school's personal approach here.  
 
Still, even though we will be able to obtain permanent residency here soon, we decided 
to move to a different country. The pandemic experience, and especially the issue of 
access to health care and us being treated as second -class citizens here, became a s ort 
of deal -breaker for us. As non -EU migrants with long -term residency, we are not part of 
the public healthcare system and have to pay for our private insurance. There have been 
many instances when it was difficult for us to register our children to spec ialists (for 
example, a dentist) or when we had to visit an emergency with them, and we were 
treated with disrespect and suspicion. On top of that, the government passed a law last 
year changing the conditions of private insurance for third -country nationa ls '' now the 
prices have gone up three times, and we are obliged to register with only one state -
owned insurance company. Yet, the issues like limited accessibility of medical care or 
 
 
   79 
 
excessive paperwork did not improve one bit. As we need to pay for the overall period 
upfront, this is a considerable amount of money that many migrants struggle to pay. If 
you are a nurse and have children, it is three and a half months of your salary. And if your 
husband works as a construction worker, your family won't be able to afford it. The 
financial side of it is not such an issue for us, but it is a matter of principle. We disagree 
with how the state denies us access to health care even though we a re here legally and 
pay taxes.  
 
This became even more apparent during the pandemic. I know that being able to go to 
a restaurant or swimming pool is not a fundamental human right, but still. While Czech 
nationals had several Covid -19 tests for free per month, we had to pay for a test eve ry 
time we wanted to use services. OK, we don't often go to restaurants, but we have small 
children and wanted to take them swimming for example. I was also among the first 
migrants to get vaccinated '' the vaccination for migrants with long -term residency 
regardless of their age or health status opened at the beginning of June 2021 '' long 
after the registration was open for all the Czechs over 18 years old [and EU citizens and 
migrants with permanent residency]. I had to pay upfront, which was reimbursed to  me 
by my private insurance after approximately one month. Our family trusts science, we 
wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, and we have the money to pay upfront. 
But again, for migrants who work as general low -skilled labour, this might be money  they 
cannot spare. That's why most migrants with long -term residency got vaccinated only 
after the Ministry lowered the price from 800 CZK to 400 CZK in November 2021.  
 
I am 39 years old, do sports, and don''t have any underlying diseases. But imagine you 
came here with your grandma, or you have a disabled relative, and you could not get a 
priority spot for them. And these people had access to covid -19 vaccination only aft er - 
and I am sorry to say that '' the last person with public healthcare. So this was a decisive 
moment for me; I felt like a second -class citizen. We like living in the Czech Republic, the 
local culture and traditions. We made friends here that are good t o us. It is a beautiful 
state well equipped for sports, great schools. But we can see that the legislation here 
has a negative impact on our lives. That's why we will be moving to a different country 
which is less like Orwell's Skotnyj dvor, the Animal Far m.''","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",3,I was planning to continue my aesthetic
United States,"''I am a 76 -year -old widow, and I have four children '' three stepsons from my 
late husband and one daughter. My husband passed away in 2018, so I live by myself. 
Luckily, two of my boys live and work nearby, so they have been helping me both before 
and during the pandemic. If there is anything I need, like, for example, helping with 
technical issues with my TV or co mputer, I call them, and they always come. My daughter 
and her family '' on the other hand '' moved across the globe and lives in Canada. But we 
talk over the phone or Skype almost every day, so we can stay in touch, and seeing her 
fit in there and thrive ma kes me happy.  
 
My daughter also instructed my neighbour''s son to come and check on me every other 
day, so I am under surveillance (laughing). My neighbour is 86 years old, and we used 
to work together; her son '' a really nice boy '' is helping me a lot, taking care of big  
grocery shopping or driving me around the town if I need to get somewhere. He even 
helped me with the vaccination '' when the registration opened for people of my age, he 
just came over and said, '''I registered you on this date at this place.'' Then he drove  me 
to the vaccination centre and back home, the same for the second dose. For the third 
booster, I called my practitioner and got vaccinated as part of my regular medical check -
up. I was a bit dizzy after one of the doses, but that''s probably because of m y blood 
pressure, which is very weather -sensitive. I was watching TV that evening, and while 
trying to get up, I fainted and fell on a small table, which got completely smashed. But I 
ended up being OK; I just had to order myself a new table, and my neighbour''s son 
came over and put it together for me.  
 
I have been visiting my daughter in Canada every year since my grandson was born; he 
is ten now. And not even the pandemic could stop me '' I was able to fly in 2020 and 
2021 as well. My daughter always arranges assistance at the airport, so someone waits 
for me with the wheelchair at the transfer. This time around, I had to present the 
confirmation of my vaccination, but other than that, not much has changed. I usually stay 
for around one month. The restrictions in Canada were similar to those in the Czech 
Republic '' masks and other stuff; my daughter has been working on the home office 
during the pandemic.  
 
I have a park right behind my apartment building, so I go for regular walks because 
being home within four walls or watching TV all the time would make me crazy. I have 
never been too much of a fan of shopping, so when stores were closed, I did not miss 
going to the shopping malls or things like that. If I need something urgently, there is a 
convenience store or grocery shop nearby. I usually go there when people work, so it''s 
not busy. And for more extensive grocery shopping, I always ask my neighbour''s so n. I 
even ordered some things '' like, for example, respirators and masks '' online and had 
them delivered. But I am only basic internet user, not a skilled one.  
 
I have a group of friends, former classmates, and colleagues I am in contact with over 
the phone. So you are not alone if you don''t want to. I studied at the University of 
Chemistry and Technology and worked in laboratories my whole life. That is why we al so 
take this seriously, not listening to the misinformation, adhering to the measures 
because we know what we can expect from this disease. Also, given our age, it is about 
other conditions and diseases we are carrying with us as well and how covid would '''get 
friendly '' with those. ''","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",3,"I was watching TV that evening, and"
United States,"''I am 37 years old, and I am in a difficult housing situation. I was staying at 
various asylum houses; the last one was in a small town in the southeast region of the 
country. I spent two months there and came back to the capital only yesterday. So I am 
trying to get back on my feet again,  looking for a spot in an asylum house for women. I 
filled in an application, and now I am waiting. I studied to be a kitchen aid staff '' I had a 
few part -time jobs here and there, working as a cashier or in the kitchen, jobs like this.  
 
The main restrictions that concern me are respirators  and Covid testing. Everywhere you 
go, like emergency shelters or day centres, you need to put a respirator on, and you 
have to have a test. I''ve heard that if you get a positive result, they put you in quarantine. 
In certain places where I stayed, it wasn ''t always mandatory to put on the mask, but I 
think all of them had a mandatory testing system in place. For example, in the asylum 
house, they were testing us every two weeks (''). [The medical team] com es over and 
does the testing for you. I also spent some time in a hospital, I was there for about six 
weeks, and visits  were fully banned. They can bring you something, like a gift for 
example, but then they have to leave. Also, they had some measures in place there, like 
keeping our distance while queuing.  
 
I was thinking about getting vaccinated. I know one can get registered at a practitioner, 
one''s doctor. So I would try it there to get a jab, a dose for free (''). I''ve heard it''s some 
sort of flu, so they say. And then not much else, people wear these resp irators, and they 
are more careful, so they don''t get sick. They keep their distance. I just want this to be 
over, for them to say, '''Enough, the disease went away, and you don''t have to wear the 
mask anymore, and all is back to normal. '' And that''s it. I ju st want to get a job, and that 
they approve my housing application. I want to live a normal life like everybody else, 
work, go home, have kids, and things like this. ''","['Healthcare', 'Workplace']",1,I am trying to get back on
United States,"''I am 41 years old and currently homeless; my difficult housing situation was 
partially caused by Covid. I used to have a part -time job helping in the kitchen, but as 
the pandemic started, part -time workers were the first ones to let off. Once I lost this job, 
I could not pay the rent. So let me tell you, this whole Covid thing seems like a pretty bad 
idea (laughing). I think the impact of the entire pandemic did not have to be this bad if 
they would soften it a bit. Restaurants especially got hi t hard; lots of them went bankrupt. 
I mean, the politicians haven't lost their salaries, huh? Alongside my part -time job, I was 
getting benefits for those with insufficient income [the Extraordinary Immediate 
Assistance]. I am still receiving that, but I c an't do much with it as it is less than 2 500 CZK 
[103 EUR] per month. Most shelters and lodging houses for homeless people are full, 
and they are not taking new people because of Covid. They were supposed to be 
opening a new hostel [turning a hostel into lodging for the homeless]. But as the virus 
spread again, they turned it into a place for those infected who need accommodation 
[to self -quarantine] (''). So I signed myself up on a waiting list; there are many of us. 
Luckily, I have a spot at the emergency  dormitory; a boat turned into a shelter. So I go 
there every evening and spend the night there because being on the street overnight, I 
wouldn't be able to handle that. I don't feel comfortable around other people on the 
street, and I don't want to associ ate with them too much. Every Thursday, an ambulance 
from the hospital comes to the shelter and tests everyone on the list. They process the 
tests and then call out names of those Covid positive through the radio so people in the 
underdecks can hear that t oo. Those infected then have to pack their things, gather at 
the front desk and wait in isolation for the ambulance to drive them to the hostel -turned -
shelter, where they spend their isolation. During the pandemic, the offices where one 
can apply for finan cial support were often closed or were collecting the applications 
online. Luckily, the girls at the foundation [an NGO supporting homeless women] are 
helping us a lot. Especially with the offices and this kind of stuff. If it weren't for them, I 
don't kno w what I would have done. The stores were also closed, but honestly, there was 
almost no money to spend, so I was barely affected by that. I got vaccinated in the 
summer at one of the day centres for the homeless by the main train station. It was for 
free,  so I told myself, OK, I'll go for it. I received the second jab just yesterday, but now I 
am wondering if it was the right thing to do since the politicians just announced that you 
would no longer need the vaccination certificate to go places. I guess may be it is better 
that I got it, but then again, so many vaccinated people got the diseases. It also seems 
to me that people are generally more nervous and anxious during the pandemic.''","['Workplace', 'Public Space']",1,"I am still receiving that, but I"
United States,"''I am in my early twenties, and I am homeless. Growing up, I lived in the 
children's home, and when I turned 18 years old, I moved to the transition, a so -called 
halfway house for young adults. From there, I went to the asylum house for women. I 
ended up quite a few times in the psychiatric hospital between the halfway and asylum 
houses. I have an anxiety -depressive disorder and borderline p ersonality disorder, and 
I started to intersperse that with drinking somehow. I used to work in a company doing 
internet surveys and questionnaires. But unfortunately, I had to end my contract there. 
First, I wasn't happy with the job, and second, I felt l ike I was not good enough for it. I 
didn't feel good enough for anything. So I resigned and started another round of 
treatment. For a while, I was able to pay the accommodation fee in the asylum house, 
but then I realized that my income was not enough. So I decided to terminate the lease 
and left the mental treatment cycle as well. All this time, I've been under constant 
pressure that I don't know what's going to happen to me, that I don't really know what 
I'm going to do next, and I just couldn't stand it anymore. So I decided to '''move -in'' with 
my mom to her tent. She has been living like this for about five or six years, and she's 
glad we're together now. However, our relationship is so complicated, and it's 
challenging for both of us. We often get into ar guments over petty things that can turn 
pretty violent quickly, especially if alcohol is involved. Just recently, I had an opportunity 
to move back to a shelter. But I don't know what to do if it's harder for me to live with my 
mom or leave her and go my o wn way.  
 
I felt the weight of the pandemic the most while in the psychiatric hospital. There has 
been a whole unit dedicated to those who either contracted Covid or had to be placed 
into quarantine because they have been exposed. Lots of activities, including thera pies, 
group therapies, and art workshops, were limited, there was a staff shortage, and the 
whole hospital worked in this limited mode. Also, they restricted and then entirely 
banned any visits, which was pretty tough, especially around Christmas. During t he past 
years, I was admitted to the hospital at least once a year, and I used to quite like my stays 
there. One gets to relax a little bit and meet new interesting people. But this time around, 
it was different. They also limited visits between different units or the number of people 
per activity; overall, people were more apart. You are never truly alone in the psychiatric 
hospital, there is no privacy and all, but still, it felt lonelier.  
 
When I got out, the first thing that surprised me was how little things improved. We 
thought - in our little micro -world - that things were getting better outside and the 
 
 
   86 
 
restrictions would loosen. But it seems not much has changed, quite the contrary. While 
on the street, the whole Covid experience is a bit easier for me. I have relative freedom, 
and I don't need to travel, so '' apart from the face masks and respirators '' nothing 
restricts me in any way.  
 
In the hospital, I was offered a free vaccination and took it. But when I told it to my mom, 
she almost slapped me. She is anti -vaccination and claims it burdens one's body. To me, 
it is not such a bad idea to get vaccinated because the more we can defend ourselves, 
the better. Thanks to the vaccination, the body can identify the disease and build a wall 
against it. Sure, there might be people who don't need it because they have strong 
enough immunity, but how do I know if that's me? So I'm kind of happy I had the 
opportunity to get vaccinated, but it's everyone's business; no one should be forced.  
 
When I talk about this with my mom, I have a feeling that she is making fun of it. Because 
my mother is older and I don't think she will ever understand this whole situation. Just 
trying to explain a respirator mandate and all that to her is incredibly har d. Occasionally, 
she puts the respirator on, but we take the public transportation together most of the 
time without wearing one. At first, I tried to convince her, telling her      to put it on. But 
lately, I gave up and joined her side. The thing is, I'm  vaccinated and, I don't know, but 
my mother probably has the strongest immunity in the city because she is seldom sick 
with anything. It probably has to do with living outdoors for almost six years. We often 
get a stare or hostile comment for not wearing a respirator. My mom claims she was once 
attacked by the '''mask -worshippers, '' as she calls them, but I don't know if that's true or 
if she was just joking. ''","['Public Space', 'Workplace']",1,"I have relative freedom, and I don't"
United States,"''I am 34 years old, and last year, I became homeless. I am originally from a 
 
city in the western part of the country. I was supposed to move to the capital because of 
a new job and apartment, but both my job and the accommodation fell through, and I 
found myself on the street. I spent the first night outside because I didn't know what to 
do. I was taken aback by the situation and cried the whole night; it was terrible. Then I 
heard about the boat -turned -shelter and went there.  
 
Back in my hometown, I was working in a factory, and I had to wear a respirator and 
protective glasses, and it was really uncomfortable. It is difficult to breathe in it, let alone 
work. It bothers me a lot, and I often have a constipated nose. I even have  respiratory 
issues that I never had before and I blame the masks. It also divides people. I find it a bit 
exaggerated that a lady will cross herself because we are in a tram together, and I don't 
have a respirator. But it doesn't bother her anymore when I  make three steps and I am 
out of the public transportation. People can be pretty mean to you if you don't have it 
on.  
 
Then there is the testing. You have to have the test everywhere you go '' day centre for 
homeless women, overnight emergency shelter, you name it. Every Wednesday, I get 
tested here in the day centre for homeless women. They have a medical team coming 
which  tests everyone, and then you have a certificate that is valid for one week, and you 
can take it to other places, like the boat shelter or the Salvation Army. What is important 
for me is to take a warm shower and keep myself sorted a bit. I want to take th e 
opportunity to praise them a bit [the organization that supports homeless women]; the 
staff is really helpful here. Of course, if you don't have a test, you can be friendly as much 
as you like, but that is the rule. But if you have it, the girls here wil l help you with anything.  
 
There are still places where no one requires the testing, though. I worked in the parking 
lot for my last part -time job, collecting money. And my employer didn't care at all 
whether I was tested, vaccinated, or whatever. I am curious about what would happe n if 
my test came back positive. I would be forced to go to a Covid hotel, they would lock 
me there, and I would fall out of the system for one week (..). And imagine you'd have a 
job where you need to be, and you wouldn't show up for a week.  
 
I have my opinion on Covid. It's mainly the destruction of humankind for me. I read 
something about the new world order, and I have completely different information. So I 
don't believe it's about Covid (''). It is more of a needless hysteria the way I see i t. It is 
essential to say that I don't belong to vaccinated people. So the question is, 
paradoxically, whether the past two years have been difficult for me or if it will be difficult 
for me if you know what I mean. I've heard that it won't be a walk in th e park for the 
unvaccinated. They are planning specific blackmailing tactics. If you are not vaccinated, 
you won't be able to go to a shop or get a job. So I am more worried about what the 
future will bring than what was happening until now.  
 
The more I think about it, the clearer it becomes that the common denominator is 
uncertainty. The uncertainty in every step you take is why the Covid situation sucks (...). 
That you don't know if it's worth finding a job, how long I'll be able to keep it? How long 
 
 
   89 
 
I'll stay negative? When I'll be positive again? Will I ever be? I don't know. Will anyone 
ever mind that I am not vaccinated? And if yes, what will happen to me? I'd say it's 
mentally hard for a person. Being in permanent insecurity, that's crazy. It doesn't help to 
be constantly stressed. And I think that's why it's all done like this. They ar e trying to 
destroy us somehow, that's what I think.  
 
Lastly, I know this is not something original, but I just want this to be over. I want my 
freedom back. I no longer want us to be divided between those tested and non -tested, 
vaccinated and unvaccinated. I want people to stop pointing fingers and saying th ey are 
better because they have more tests or vaccination doses (crying). I just want it to end. ''","['Public Space', 'Workplace']",1,both my job and the accommodation fell
Indonesia,"''I am 21 years old, and I have lived in the Czech Republic for the past five and 
a half years. I am originally from Indonesia - we moved here because my dad was 
studying and then got a job. I have three more siblings - younger twin sisters and a 
younger bro ther who is seven.  
 When the pandemic started, I was in the final years of my high school studies. The school 
closed down, we stayed home for a week or two, and then online  education started. 
Occasionally, there were some technical issues with the internet, either on my side or on 
the teacher's side, but otherwise , it was OK. Luckily, my school was quite good (''), they 
adapted quite well. It was not perfect, but it was enough to study all of the required 
things.  What bothered me the most was the uncertainty. We were unsure whe ther the 
final high school exams would get cancelled or somehow be reorganized. In the end, I 
was quite lucky because they cancelled the Czech language exam altogether. I must 
admit that both the level of the coursework as well as the required standard dec reased 
a bit, so the coursework was not bad. I have two close friends. I used to call them every 
day. So when I encountered any issues with homework or anything, they always helped 
me. Yeah, if I were alone during the time, like, doing homework and studyin g by myself, 
it certainly would be difficult. My friends helped me a lot. I was then accepted to the 
university in 2021 without any entrance exam; they just checked my high school results. 
The classes are offline, and we go to campus, but I had some diffic ulties catching up as 
the courses are way more demanding than what I experienced at high  school.  
 
My dad worked from home, and my mom is a stay -at-home mom, so not much has 
changed in this regard. I am close with my family, so I did not feel alone, especially since 
I kept in touch with my friends online. My younger siblings all go to a school that has a 
special program for migrant children. The online study affected my little brother the 
most because he doesn't really speak Czech very well. And he needed help. But my 
parents couldn't help 100%. I also helped him, but I had my own studies so I couldn't d o 
it all the time. Typically, his schools offer an extra Czech language course, but I think the 
frequency of the classes decreased a little bit during the pandemic. We do not speak 
Czech at home, so that plays a huge role.  
 
I got permanent  residency only recently. Up until then, I had private insurance. So I had 
to pay every time I went to get a PCR test, I think something around 800 CZK [33 EUR]. 
When I had [the private insurance], I decided to just wait for the free vaccine. But when I 
got [access to the public insurance], I got Covid. So yeah, it was like three months ago, 
and then I got the certificate that I had already gone through the disease, which is valid 
for six months. So I am not vaccinated yet.''","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,I had some diffic ulties catching up
United States,"''I am 53 years old, and I live in a small town close to the Czech -German 
borders. I have three children '' two of them are adults, my youngest son is 14 years old 
'' and I have worked as a nurse in a social centre in a city in Bavaria since 2018. Before 
that,  I worked as a nurse in the Czech Republic. I am the so -called pendler, which is an 
expression for someone who commutes to work and back across the borders daily.  
 
When the pandemic struck, our government closed the borders and left only one border 
crossing in the area open. In a matter of days, the management of the social centre where 
I work together with employers pleaded with the German government to give an 
exem ption for pendlers working in the so -called critical infrastructure. On the one hand, 
I was glad, but on the other hand, it brought me lots of difficulties, both mental and 
physical (''). The commute that usually takes twenty -five minutes got stretched to t hree 
hours and fifty minutes. Mainly because the government closed most of the crossings, 
and all the critical infrastructure workers and truck drivers were queening at the one 
crossing that remained open. For me, it meant leaving for work three hours earl ier, 
working my shift, and then driving home for three hours again (''). It got to a point where 
it was psychologically and physically unbearable. There was also lots of paperwork, the 
requirements were constantly changing, and we had to check several websi tes and 
sources on a daily basis. Otherwise, they would not let us through. We also had to get 
tested every 48 hours, which was not easy at all during the first wave. Back then, the 
testing stations were only at the border crossing. At times, I was waiting  there in line for 
three hours in the winter, the snow, and the cold. And it was a bit like - how to say that - 
mental exhaustion and even a war -like feeling. I don't know, I've never experienced a 
war, so I can't imagine what it's like, but it was really hard for us.  
 
Our employer was extra accommodating, though, switching our shifts so we could at 
least make it to work on time. Later on, they also offered me a place in a dormitory which 
was more like a fully equipped four -style hotel. The quality of the accommodation w as 
outstanding, that wasn't the issue. But when I stayed there, even though I have two adult 
children, I still have a fourteen -year -old son, then a twelve -year -old, and two dogs. And 
it was a bit difficult for me when I was lying there, not knowing how it was going to evolve; 
no one really knew. For example, I have a friend who works with me. She is a nurse, but 
she is a single mother, and has two children, a similar age as my youngest. It was 
 
 
   92 
 
extremely difficult for her. She had a mental breakdown, crying for a really long time. 
When we talked about it, not knowing what'd happen next, she said: '''What is going to 
happen now? Will the borders remain closed, and they will just bring our children to the 
fences for us to at least see them or what? '' I was not as pessimistic, mainly because I 
knew my husband and my older son were home.  
 
There has been lots of fear and unknown in the first wave, causing this sort of hysteria 
that labelled pendlers as the '''virus spreaders, '' even though the numbers show that 
many cases were not brought to the Czech Republic this way. I was, for example, taking 
gas at the gas station, and a cashier told me, '''So you are coming from Germany, bringing 
the virus with you, huh? '' But on the other hand, there has been a tremendous solidarity 
among the pendlers, sharing information about new rules, paperwork, or the t raffic 
situation. Also, we received a huge amount of support from our employer, the clients, 
and the German side in general. We received lots of gifts, food, fruits, and sweets. They 
probably thought that a well -fed nurse would last longer (laughing). Peop le were leaving 
thank -you notes and flowers on our cars. So this was really nice. But those were tough 
times; we struggled with staff shortage, many people fell sick, and we worked eight days 
in a row. However, I have never thought about leaving work, leav ing those people 
behind. We were already understaffed, and the thought I would leave the patients? No, 
that is not in my nature. I'm pretty stubborn.  
 
My husband and my older son work in a factory that produces plastic wrapping, and they      
soon got an exemption as well and were able to commute as the demand for single -use 
wrappings sky -rocketed. So we all have been swamped, and it was challenging at t imes 
to sync our schedules to make sure someone is always home with our youngest and 
takes care of the dogs. The upside of it is that we weren't impacted financially by the 
pandemic. But I know some people who didn't work in what was classified as essentia l 
labour, didn't get any exemption and lost their income. With us working so much, our 
youngest was occasionally left home alone. But luckily, he is well organized, doing all his 
homework and in general, keen on school. So we had virtually zero issues with  him or 
his online education. Also, our local school has been helpful and well organized. I can 
imagine it could have been an issue for others with smaller children, though. This 
pandemic experience is also a testament to what extent      Germany is depend ent on 
cross -border labour, especially in healthcare and social services. ''","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",3,"I was lying there, not knowing how"
United States,"''I am 38 years old, mother of four kids, a social educator, and we are self -
employed, my husband and I. I have been working as a social educator until I became 
mother. After the second child, we founded a cafe. This was a tough time, I did not take 
the time  for my cot, was standing in the kitchen, preparing cakes for the cafe during the 
nights.  
Since I am self -employed, I have always been working a lot from home, especially doing 
the accounting stuff. Therefore, there has not been a big change in my professional 
activities through the pandemic. What was difficult for us was the fact that we work in 
gastronomy and we really did not know what could happen during that time. For me, 
with the beginning of the pandemic, the workload was reduced, there was not too much 
to do in the accounting. During the first lockdown, we just closed the cafe and honest ly, 
I was happy about that because due to the whole home -schooling  conditions I could 
focus on taking care of my children. Before the pandemic, my husband was responsible 
for the work in our cafe and I was the family and home manager plus the accountant for 
the cafe. That work was made by me in the evenings when the chil dren had gone to bed. 
With the pandemic, this work distribution changed. As my husband spent more time at 
home, he could also take care of home schooling and household. The pandemic led to 
more equality in our relationship,  and it was not the case that we had more disputes 
during the lockdowns than before. For us, it was positive to see that our children had us 
two as a reference person. I had less work to do and he was there. Of course, we also 
tried not to panic even thoug h we were not sure about our financial situation. I have to 
admit that everything works more smoothly when there are restrictions as when the 
normal business is running. Now, he is again more present in the cafe and I am at  home 
with the children.  
 
We both agreed that we have to stay positive even though without knowing what will 
happen. We were very grateful for what we have: we have a big apartment with a garden, 
the children could play there outside in spite of the restrictions. We were able to ma ke 
some family trips to the forest or other places which is not the case when my husband 
works regularly. He generally has to work a lot on the weekends but during the 
lockdowns he had time for the family. We agreed that the children are the focus and we 
have to support them in their development during that time. This was our most important 
thought. Especially for my daughter you had just entered school. My husband was happy 
he had more time to spend with his children.  
 
Even though, we had one negative experience which was the opening and closure of 
our third cafe. We had opened up a third cafe just three weeks before the outbreak of 
the pandemic in Germany and after some months we were not able to keep it. Even the 
to-go-business did not help us since we had not built up a clientele. This cafe did not 
 
 
   96 
 
survive the pandemic. We did not receive any financial aid from the state and lost all the 
investments we had made. We were only able to exceed this loss because of the good 
running business of our first and second already established cafes.  
 
Our last child was born during the pandemic. Now, I cannot work anymore as an 
accountant of the cafe. It has just become too much for me with four children and with 
the experience I had at the beginning. My husband supports me with this decision. I am 
happ y about this decision because otherwise it wouldn't have been healthy for me. My 
last child needs me more than the others, he is awake during the nights when I used to 
do some work for the cafe. My mother used to help me a lot but also she is becoming 
olde r. Everything is more: four children, household, etc. My husband and me, we take 
care of each other, it has become more in the last years.

United States,"''I have been living in Germany for 18 years and am 39 years old. I have two 
kids and am married to a Moroccan man. We are an international family.  
In my country of origin, Belarus, I studied languages. I came to Germany as an au -pair to 
learn German and already some weeks after arriving in Germany, I decided that this 
would the country I want to live in. I learned German, studied and got married stil l as a 
student. We have now been together for 15 years. Two years after our wedding, our son 
was born.  
I would say that we are not a family with a typical role repartition because we decided 
one day that the first one getting a job would be the one working and I drew the lot 
being this person. My son was 9 months old at that time which meant that my husband  
took care of him and I worked full -time. Two year later, our daughter was born and I 
stayed at home for just 3 months due to economic reasons, but first in a part -time 
position. I had 2 hours of journey going to work and coming back, it actually felt like  
working full -time. I am working at a corporate company as a team manager in the IT 
sector. Also nowadays, my husband is the one taking care of all the children -related 
tasks, he does homework with my son and picks them up from school and kindergarten. 
 
I have never done that.    
I have now been working for two years from home, my son is in school and my daughter 
will enter school this year. As I work in an IT -company, we always had the opportunity to 
work from home but since the beginning of pandemic, our office is closed and now that 
I am at home I get to realize more what happens at home and with my kids. This is really 
something that has changed in my life. I still remember when my son lost his first tooth. 
It happened during the day, he came home from school, running into my of fice room, 
showing me his tooth. And I was so moved that I had to cry because in normal 
circumstances I would not have been there to live this moment with him. Now, after 
school and kindergarten, my children first come into my office to tell me about their  day. 
I am very happy to be part of this now.  
 
Of course, there are still some negative aspects. I don't have time for myself and I still 
have to take care of the house. My husband supports me in some way but he does just 
some little things. I really have to plan how to keep the house tidy. This has al so changed 
during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, my husband had to take care of many things 
because he knew that I was not there to cook the lunch or clean the kitchen afterwards. 
It was always his task. Now, I am being involved in more things. I reall y have a lot of 
responsibility and duties at my job, I actually don't want to take care of these other stuff. 
I need to clear my head sometimes.  
 
My children have a lot of activities and therapies in the afternoon. Before I began to work 
at home, my husband would have taken always both children to the activity of one of 
them. Now, that I am at home, he leaves one child at home with me, though I am w orking. 
This is an additional burden for me. My husband had to learn in the last months that I am 
there but not there at the same time.  
 
But I don't want to talk only about the negative aspects. I have to admit that the house -
related tasks can be managed sometimes also during the work hours. Furthermore, I am 
very thankful that we have a huge flat where I can close my office door and work s ilently.  
During the lockdown, my children had to stay at home, my son had to be taught at 
home...this was really stressful for all of us. Yet, my husband took care of all these tasks. 
Still, I hope that the schools will remain open. For my son, who does not have so  many 
friends, the attempt to find new ones was really hard because most of the parents did 
not want to take part in birthday parties or other events.  
I have also realized that we never appreciated the time we spent with colleagues 
preparing a coffee in the office kitchen or having a short chat. I think that this is the basis 
for a good work environment and collaboration. All of that has now been lost. I  believe 
that new regulations like working some days in the office and some days at home would 
be perfect.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",3,I had 2 hours of journey going
United States,"''I am 75 years old and I have a family with two children, single mother. I have 
always been working as an artist self -employed but also was a lecturer at a University. I 
am divorced and have never married again but have been living with different partners 
or roommates. My financial situation was always a bit sparingly, I have always tried to 
find additional work resources during my life, especially when my children still lived with 
me. Then the idea arose to share my atelier with other artists. I have always  been very 
satisfied also with everything I had. With the age of 65, I retired, as it is usual in Germany. 
I also moved to a smaller space also in regards to my pension. But this is not unfortunate, 
I was happy to limit my belongings to the minimum necessa ry. Until now, I have always 
been sharing this space with other people and it works very well. With the pandemic, 
some things have changed due to the contact restrictions and an accident I had with my 
bike which led to severe physical constraints. I still had contact with my friends through 
WhatsApp -groups, expecting to meet soon, that this time will pass by. Now, I am better 
and every morning I go to the forest to some waling and I am one of the few women that 
does it on her own. I need this time to enjoy nature. During that time, I met a woman I 
knew through another friend and then she told me that she was mortally ill. She really 
impressed me because she continued her life very positively, living with a lot of animals. 
She told me her wish to die at home and stay there together with her pets. I felt the wish 
to accompany her in this last journey as I am also at an age where we deal with death 
and especially for me, as I am also a single. Due to this happening, the people 
surrounding her created a - so to s ay - new circle of friends with the purpose to support 
her with some daily life tasks. This was done between us women; we even did not think 
about involving the men. During the pandemic, we all had to adapt the contact 
restrictions, there were no problems at all, we were all healthy. It was impressive that due 
to the restrictions I gained new close ties to at least two persons. Of course, there are 
always people that are very fearful, especially the younger people and families felt a bit 
safer.  
 
I am a person that loves to be moving around and being with other people. Currently, I 
am taking care of my ex -husband who is living in care home because of dementia. My 
children resent me for doing that because he simply wasn't a good father. I just reali ze 
that he depends now so much on other people and he is really helpless. Due to the 
pandemic, of course I have to test before visiting him and it is really not comfortable to 
visit people at this care home. There is no possibility of coming together in a natural way, 
there are these plastic separations, really not comfortable. Imagine, sitting there with a 
 
 
   99 
 
person with dementia. So I prefer to go out with him for a walk. I have the impression 
that this situation is worse for men than for women because they are used to not show 
any fears and helpless behavior. I feel that I am doing something good. But my children 
really judge me for doing this but I have been divorced for so many years and am h appy 
to be able to help. For me, it is more important to give instead of taking. My children, 
they are already more than 40 years old, have suffered from their father an d still it seems 
that their lives are influenced by their experience during childhood. Who suffers more 
from that is my older son who has not had a male role model.  
For me, the pandemic has shown that the physical contact is so important. And this need 
is not easy to be replaced. At least with the phone, we can talk to people, listen to the 
voice or have a video conference and create some kind of relationship. Includi ng me 
and my son, a lot of people have acquired pets to substitute the human physical contact.  
  
I would also like to add something regarding my artistic work. I used to be in different 
groups where we met to draw together and some weeks ago we met for the first time 
after two years to draw. It was interesting to see that I am coming back to what I be gan. 
I am still not sure if I am continuing the same thing or if I shall do something different. 
Maybe I have unlearned drawing, I don't know.",['Domestic'],3,I felt the wish to accompany her
United States,"''My name is Susanne and I live together with my husband and our six -
months -old son. We got married before the birth of our kid, but have been together for 
eight years and moved together very fast. My parents live in another region in Germany, 
I came here be cause of my studies and stayed because of the love. I had some longer 
study exchanges in Italy and Latin America. My husband was born and raised in 
Germany, but his parents come from Morocco. He has no strong strings to this country 
and feels here at home.  He is self -employed and I am a full -time employee at a company 
but at the moment I am at home for maternity leave and plan to stay home for two years. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, I have been working in home office all the time which 
was great. I had  more time for private life, to do sports or other things. I was very flexible, 
could also do some purchases during my work hours in the lunch break. My husband 
was also lucky after the beginning of the pandemic since he is metal worker and during 
that tim e, many people began to renovate their houses which means that he has more 
  
 
work than before the pandemic.  
I feel that I am a single mother since my husband works a lot. He always tries to be there, 
but in the end I am all day long alone with my child. This has also affected his relationship 
to our child, as he did not want to be taken by my husband and always cried. This was 
especially at the beginning. Now it is getting a bit better.  
 
Regarding household, nothing has changed. Before the pandemic, I was the only one 
doing the cleaning, cooking, purchasing, everything and he just worked. I prefer to do 
all this during the week and on Sundays I manage to visit some friends because 
otherwis e we would just stay at home. I am the manager at home. Since I am a mother, 
we arranged someone to take over the cleaning at our home once a week. I cannot take 
care of everything. For me it is more important to buy fresh products and prepare healthy 
food  therefore somebody has to do the cleaning. And he is the one paying for it. I myself 
also cleaned other people's houses when I was a student and I know what it means to 
clean properly other people's places.  
 
I don't feel any restrictions nowadays. I do a lot of activities with my son, e.g. swimming 
for babies. Since there are test centers everywhere, I use this opportunity just to be sure, 
as I am also vaccinated. Only at the beginning, when there were no test  centers, you had 
to make a real effort to get tested and participate in social activities. I am lucky that all 
the post -partum activities took place in person. But still there are women that do not feel 
save taking part in person and would like to switch to an online -course.  
 
There is one thing that annoys me which is the different rules that have to be considered. 
At certain places it is enough to be vaccinated, at other places you need an additional 
test, etc. There is no general rule and sometimes I don't know where to look up the 
information. For example, I find it easier to find this information in the Italian press than 
in the German press.  
 
I got vaccinated because I wanted to have the liberty to take part in social life and events 
with my baby. Before I got vaccinated, I wasn't able to buy clothes for my son because 
of the regulations. When I was pregnant, there was no vaccination recommenda tion for 
pregnant women and when my child was born, there was no recommendation for 
nursing women. Therefore, I got my first vaccinations just some months ago. I felt a bit 
insecure but when I realized that in the postpartum course everybody got vaccinated , I 
also decided to take this step.  
 
I am really not a fearful person. Of course, I try to be careful, always test myself and I 
really don't want to get the virus but I feel that it is coming closer to us. In my family, a lot 
of people already got infected with Omikron. I am really tired of t he pandemic, it affects 
the economy, it affects relationships, we should try to live with it. A friend of mine just 
got separated. Her husband always worked on assembly and then suddenly he was at 
home all the time and they had to bear with each other. The  pandemic destroyed their 
relationship. I just wish to have a normal life, especially for our kids. Childcare should 
work properly. Not everybody is lucky to be able to work in home office and take care of 
 
the children at the same time. I could not imagine to be working while taking care of my 
child. There has to be found a solution on how to live with the pandemic. Things have 
really changed. Before the pandemic, for example children played together at the 
playground. Nowadays, every child plays on its own, this is horrible in my eyes.

United States,"''My name is Vanha, I am from Mozambique, I am 48 years old and I have 
been living in Germany since 2012. I live here with my family, my husband and my 21 -
year -old daughter. My husband has already been living in Germany since 1986 and for 
us it was not that easy to adapt here, we come from another culture. It was not easy but 
we got used to it. My husband had already acquired the German way of thinking; he 
came when he was 17. He lost a bit also the African culture. He was young. We had to 
adapt also to each other because we had different ways of seeing things, he knew more 
the European culture. For example, in Africa, the issue of being on time is not our 
strength. Here it is very important. In Africa, pupils can arrive late at school and here it is 
very diff erent. I remember that my daughter had problems because when we still lived 
in Mozambique, she arrived late at school and it was never a problem at all. When she 
came here, every time she was late at school, the teacher recorded the missing hours 
even thou gh she was there. She accumulated so many missed hours that we received a 
letter from the Ministry of Education asking my daughter to do community service or pay 
a penalty. So she opted for the community service. That happened twice. Then she 
realized that  things work differently here and she changed her behaviour. She has really 
adapted to the society. Thank God. My husband learned us a lot, he was a real support.  
I work as a cleaner since I came here. As I did not speak German that well I did not have 
other opportunities because for cleaning you don't need any qualification. I also had to 
work a lot because I had to pay some language courses for my daughter as she did not 
speak any German when she came here. I had already a basic command of the German 
language.  
 
Some time ago, I attended a course for caregivers of elderly people, which I liked. There, 
I had to attend two internships accompanying people. I found it interesting but 
afterwards I realized that I would not have earned more than cleaning. I am already used 
to clean, I have also some liberties and for me it is not a hard physical work. My 
professional life changed when I came to Germany. In Mozambique I had been working 
as an accountant at a big transnational company. If I wanted to work as an accountant in 
Germany, this would not be possible as you need a special vocabulary and I did not have 
a good command of the language.  
 
My husband has a full -time job, I have a part -time job and my daughter is doing an in -
company training where she also has to attend school. So the household remains with 
me. I do what I can. On the weekends we do the cleaning, sometimes my daughter helps. 
My husband is a man (laughing), he does some things, he takes away the garbage, does 
the laundry, his laundry and mine, my daughter washes her own clothes. He washes, I 
do the ironing. But sometimes, when I don't have time, he also does the cooking. My 
daughter does the cooking, as well. My husband and me, we eat Portuguese or 
Mozambican food, my daughter - as she was also raised here - cooks the food people 
eat here like pizza. At home, everybody eats what he or she wants.  
 
When the pandemic began, for us it was a hard time, we had some financial problems. 
It came together that we had to leave our flat because the owner wanted to make some 
refurbishments. We moved. Then with Covid, my husband's work hours were reduced, I 
lost one of my jobs. Our new flat was not ready, we still had to do some renovations but 
we had to stop because of our financial situation. This pandemic really brought a lot of 
problems to us. My husband had to carry the financial burden and the expenses 
chan ged and I was not earning enough money. It also had an influence on our private 
life: We all had to stay at home. During the lockdown, we tried to get along, we could 
not leave our small home. It was some kind of stress. My daughter stayed only in her 
room  but she was tired of staying at home. She sometimes left her room to go to the 
toilet or eat something. TV and the phone were our best friends.  
 
Now, I am still working less hours. My husband is working full -time but I am still waiting 
to find a new job. But I want to travel first to Mozambique in the summer before looking 
for a new job.","['Workplace', 'Education']",3,"am already used to clean, I have"
United States,"''I am Charlotte, I live in Germany and am a dancer. I am married and have an 
almost 2 -year -old daughter. We are a migrant family. I have been living in Germany for 
8 years. 7 years ago I met my husband who was living in Great Britain at that time. He 
came to Germany 3 years ago to live with me.  
  
When I came here, I was part of touring dance groups. Afterwards, I began to work as a 
freelancing dancer but it was a hard time because dancing is not a very reliable job. As I 
support also my family in Senegal and I pay all the expenses here, I did not m ake it to 
earn enough for our living why I started to work additionally in different domains.  
I was working in a kindergarten when I became pregnant. It was the moment when I 
decided that I would prefer to work with elderly people and to pursue the required 
vocational training. I like it and I am still working in this field. When there are bad times 
at work, I think of my family and why I am doing all this: Paying school for my brothers, 
supporting everybody over there. I won't quit just because of one person.  
 
I became a mother during the first Corona -lockdown. After three months of my 
pregnancy, I was prohibited to work [Editor's note: This is generally done when the 
pregnant woman works in a domain of strong contact to other people]. Additionally, my 
cervix wa s opened already at the beginning, I was sick during all my pregnancy. I was 
neither able to dance nor to do any sports and even spent some months at the hospital.  
The conditions during the pandemic, of course, affected us a lot since we live on dancing 
at big shows, events and workshops. Everything was cancelled. And my husband was 
still only working as a dancer, he did not have any additional occupation. We had to 
apply for the general state subsidies but I was in hospital and my husband did not have 
the required knowledge of the German language back then. I could not receive visits 
during that time due to the pandemic, just my husband for two hours per day, and I r eally 
could not take care of this. My husband himself was not allowed to ask for state aid as he 
has another nationality. It was a really hard time because we had not received any 
income for more than four months. It was a catastrophe. I couldn't even slee p when 
being in hospital because I was so worried about this whole situation. I think that it 
affected my baby inside my belly. And then, when I was home to take care of all the 
paperwork, I really felt that the German administration just does not care abo ut the 
people. They have rules to follow and don't care about the people behind the letters 
and phone calls. How shall a person take care of all this paperwork when you are in 
hospital?! It is simply not possible. I then also realized that life in Germany can be very 
hard, even sometimes harder than in Senegal. There, at least, you can ask the owners of 
your flat, to pay the rent later because of financial difficulties. Here, don't even think 
about this option!  
 
I really have to say, I won't ever forget corona, it was the hardest time.  
I came out of hospital in April, took care of all the paperwork and then my daughter was 
born in May. Directly when she was born, I began to look for a new job. I was really fed 
up and did not want to depend on the state at all. Since then, I feel free. An d I am a 
feminist, I like to work and I don't want to depend on anybody. Even though, we are sad

that we are not dancing as we did before. Dancing was our life. Also my husband had to 
adapt. He learned German after our daughter's birth, looked for another occupation and 
now has different jobs. Corona just changed everything in our lives.  
My dream is to finish having my house built for my family in Senegal and that my brothers 
and sisters find a good job. I come from another culture, another country. Me, I think that 
if I succeed but my brothers and sisters don't, then it is no success.

United States,"''I am Heike, I am 35 years old, mother of 4 children. My oldest daughter is 15 
years old, one son is 9, the other 7 and the youngest is one. My three first children were 
born during my studies. In 2014, I suffered from cancer directly after the birth of my third 
child and since then I am incapacitated for work due to the repercussions of my illness. 
In 2015, I then separated from my two first children's father. For many years, I have been 
a single -mother and until now my current partner and fathe r of my last child is not living 
with us because we just haven't found a place that could be large enough to live 
together. But in half a year, we will be moving to a house and I am very happy about that.  
I have mostly been the only responsible person for the education and care of my 
children. Especially in my last relationship, it was very clear that I am the sole responsible 
for them. Even though my partner at that time was also a student and took some 
semesters off to take care of the children, it was me who did all the work. Now, I am 
officially a single -mother and the children live mainly with me, so that during the time of 
the pandemic it was me who took care of home -schooling for example; Also on the days 
when the father was supposed to take them. As he works and I don't, it was always clear 
that I was the one taking care. Therefore I can say, that the pandemic had an effect on 
me, having my children all the time around. All the four of them. The last one was born 
end of 2020 and then the second strong lockdown came and I was at home in childbed, 
doing home schooling and taking care of everything. My current partner was not allowed 
to take paternity leave because we are not living together. But he pays alimony. Of 
course, it was a very tough time but I really did not take it as very onerous. I was just 
happy that we were healthy. The cancer illness had been the toughest time for us.  
In general, all the partners refused to take paternity leave as I am home anyway due to 
 
my incapacitation. It has really always been like that. And from my last relationship, I have 
learned and decided that I want to do that differently in the future. My current partner 
woks as well and I am just working as a freelancing journalist occasionally, but it is really 
not regular. I just felt that I had to use all my energy in more importan t things in the last 
year that I simply did not have the power to enforce this support. In addition, I know that 
my children don't have such a good time with thei r father, why I prefer to do everything 
by myself.  
 
Regarding the financial situation, this hasn't change due to the pandemic because these 
worries had always been present. My current partner is a musician and, of course, now 
he has been earning much less. The biggest burden for me were the restrictions for  the 
hospitals, nobody could visit me during and after the birth. Also the medication I need 
was mostly not available. And of course the general situation: We cannot inspect 
kindergartens due to the pandemic. This limits us in some way.  
 
Regarding my illness, I am incapacitated for some years. I just have one vocal cord which 
means that I cannot speak for too much time. As I have studied to be a social worker, I 
will not be able to consult people. Besides, my hands are numb and I suppose t hat this 
will stay like this forever. Officially, I will be healed in 2 or 3 years, therefore I will not be 
able to work regularly but I really want to focus again on writing and continuing the path 
of journalism at least as a side job.  
 
In 2020, I published a book about my illness and about the time afterwards when the 
doctors discovered my 4 -year -old's tumor disease.  
 
I don't feel that I can work now. I still have so many commitments with my doctors, 
physical therapist and so on. And I have to wait until my youngest son will enter the 
kindergarten.","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,single -mother and the children live
Germany,"''I am a 66 -year -old retired woman.  
At my work - a center for international women - where I work on an honorary basis, most 
of the women work voluntarily and are retired. These women also felt limited: they 
couldn't continue teaching German, giving sewing classes and others, all the activiti es 
that we offer to vulnerable women had to be cancelled. This affected, hence, even more 
the ones that benefit from our offers and courses: vulnerable women because of being 
migrants, fleeing from their countries in conflict, being already elderly women o r 
mothers of older or younger children, mostly single mothers, and much more. They were 
the ones that lost meeting, networking and exchange opportunities in Germany.  
Generally, these women are not able to take part in the regular national integration 
courses because either they don't have the access or they are not available on the times 
proposed because of child care or professional commitments. At our center, they ca n 
bring their children as we offer child care during the classes. Furthermore, women can 
receive very individual support at our center. This can be in very different aspects of their 
lives, also for their children for example, when they are applying for a job or want to have 
 
their foreign academic titles recognized.  
Some of these women have isolated themselves completely during the pandemic. But 
we really wanted to continue with our activities and after short time tried to reorganize 
our work conditions, considering sanitation measures everywhere. We were happy to 
receive a donation of sanitary masks that we could offer. The women were and still are 
very grateful.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",2,I am a 66 -year -old retired
United States,"''I am Lidia, I am 37 years old, have two kids and am a deputy store manager 
at a German supermarket chain. I have been a single -mother for already six years, my 
kids are 8 and 3 years old. Since then, everything has become much more complicated 
because of the child care situation. I always depend on other people and my work hours 
just don't fit the hours of kindergarten. With one child it was already hard but still 
possible in a way, but my second child was not planned and then now with the covid -
situation it is just frustrating, with home schooling, the lockdowns, the closed 
kindergarten, etc. I don't have the possibility of working in home office, therefore I had 
to extend my parental leave and have been receiving unemployment benefits even 
though I am sti ll employed. And I cannot go back to work because there is always a 
reason why one of the children has to stay at home. I am receiving a little part of my 
salary but in the next months this payment will end and I will be officially unemployed. I 
have sole custody of my children. Their father is a soldier and has been deployed in 
different countries. I was alone during my second pregnancy and also alone during the 
birth. Actually, my son is supposed to be every Friday at his father's house, but in reality 
this is not the case. It always depends on his work situation and at the moment his father 
is on sick leave because of a post -traumatic stress disorder. What means that, of course, 
I sometimes prefer my children to be at home with me instead of spending time  with 
their worried father. Luckily, he pays alimony. I am thankful that we have a good 
relationship despite everything, my ex can come to our home and see his children 
whenever he wants. Currently, he is with us approx. every second day. And I also have a  
boyfriend. Sometime I feel bad and sorry for my children that I was not able to provide 
a '''normal'' family life to them, but you never know what comes next in life. Last year, I 
began to carry out a continuing education as a homeopathic practitioner of 
psychotherapy which ended last month. I am pursuing some further advanced trainings 
in this field and I do also already have a space where to pursue my new profession and 
soon I want to begin to work as a freelancer. Maybe I can have a part -time job in retail 
but I really don't get a job because of being a single mother - I am not flexible enough. 
When I am at my job interview, I never lie, I just say what the situation is.    
Home schooling and the lockdowns were not always too bad for us because we all like 
to spend time at home and sometimes we enjoyed the time of being together. But even 
though, my 8 -year -old son is very demanding. I sometime feel left alone. In these 
situat ions, it is not only a problem that I cannot work; I just never have time for myself. 
Really, with two children it is very demanding. Also the additional information and 
exchange with the kindergarten, the school, whatsapp -groups with other parents, the 
information sent by the ministry of education, etc. I just cannot read all of this! That is an 
additional effort.  
 
I want to add that I am really not a fearful person, also in relation to covid. Of course, I 
don't want to get it, but some people really exaggerate. They are afraid but without 
being in danger. I wish more state support for single -mothers. I don't know ex actly how 
but something would need to change on the labor market. It is very obvious that there 
is no company who wants to give a job to a single -mother. If I could work from home, I 
would also work in the evening, I would be flexible in this way.  Of cour se, I have 
existential fears. What will happen if I have not been working for so many years?! Who 
would give a job to me? At the same time, I also want to take care of my children and 
would not like to give them away the whole day. But the cost of living h as risen and that 
is a problem. Nevertheless, I always try to be positive and confident. And thinking about 
the men: you can forget about them. I think that this last generation of men has to find 
its identity. I don't want to say that my ex is a bad fathe r. He really tries to give his best 
and I am always happy when he spends time with our children. But he does not have 
patience, he has had a bad childhood himself. And I don't want to say that all men are 
bad, but there are just two types of men: sissies w hich are more woman than man, and 
then there are these hardcore masculine men. For example, my current boyfriend is a 
great man, he is even able to communicate in an appropriate way. But there is one thing 
about which I am pretty sure: boys just don't have  good male examples.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",3,I am pursuing some further advanced trainings
Brazil,"I am 78 years old. I have been in the corporate life for most of my life. I had 
two senior  jobs and I have worked as a salesperson all my life. I have been self employed 
for 18 years. Then I was with a company for 23 years as a salesperson. After the  8 
financial crisis I voluntarily resigned and then I saw a new job in the newspaper. It was a 
super job that I had for 4,5 years. It was well paid and it  was with really great colleagues. 
I am a divorcee by choice and I have three children and I have lived alone for 40 years. I 
had tried being married and I had tried having children. I live in a small city in the 
northern part of Zealand. I found out that this could be a solution. I have 9 grandchildren 
and I have two great grandchildren. I know everything about family life. I am a member 
of DaneAge (Ældresagen) and was a member of the board. They were not doing 
anything because of corona. We thought that w as wrong. Last year before the 
restrictions were completely removed we did four events in July and continued until the 
lockdown in December. In the meantime we were elected to the board. We have had 
full blast, we just had an entertainer for 94 people. Nor mally, we are around 150 
attending, but because of corona we have gone by with 60 -70. That is fair. Some are sick 
and some are a bit scared. One couple in my network, where the husband is sick, they 
are so scared of corona, that we have not seen them for 2  years. That is a bit extreme. 
One of my sons lives 500 km. from where I live. I was infected with corona last year. My 
buddy sadly died with corona. When I was infected we found a way to solve it. My 
impression is that the well -functioning, the ones that are a bit outgoing, maybe around 
10-20 % they have felt it. But the grandparents and great grandparents were not flooded 
with visits from relatives before. I can see with myself, my one child lives in Copenhagen 
and the other one lives in another city. I d on't see them as often as I see the son that lives 
close to me. I have my daughter, she is against the vaccine, she is a health apostle and 
believes that the body can cure the disease itself. That has created some conflicts. My 
best buddy died from corona on the 30th of January last year, he would not have lived 
five more years, he was already sick. But corona is what gave the push. That for sure has 
created a conflict. Or maybe not conflict, but disharmony. My buddy, Jens, his wife Maria 
and I, we had a bu siness for 18 years. We had a close relationship. I do not want to listen 
to those who do not want to get vaccinated and say that it doesn't matter, we can just do 
whatever. I do not share that opinion. Of course you need to show consideration towards 
othe r people. You have to do that in all aspects of life. There is a woman in our 
community. When we have lunch all of the other people complain about their food. She 
does not want to complain. She says not to spend time on that nonsense. I think a lot of 
peop le are like that. We were three people alone together on New Year's. January 6th I 
was called and asked to take a corona test. I was infected as well. Jens was put in the 
hospital on January 9th and was there the whole time. Since I have lived alone for 40  
years, it was no problem. I think you can compare it to when spouses loose their partner. 
In the beginning there is a huge sense of grief. Some of them find a solution and some 
 
 
   112 
 
of them never find a solution. Our future is shorter than our past. Two years is a huge 
chunk. People deal with it in different way. I think the media exacerbates the issues. You 
start to sort the information that you get. Some of it is supposed to scare people and 
make people angry with the government. Denmark has made it well through the 
pandemic. We don't have that many deaths. If they want to know about the pandemic 
they should be sent to Brazil. Then they can count the massgraves or Northern Italy in 
the spring of 2020. They would have a different relation to it. The things that we cannot 
change we should not spend our time on. They will happen either way. In our family 
some people have parties and some don't. We were at a birthday last year, where my 
grandchild and her husband were tested because they would not hold the blame for 
creating a ravage. As I see it they were considerate towards the elderly. It has been 
difficult with the masks. I have also attended events in the city, where we had to wear 
masks. You have to decide if you want to use the mask in the metro or do you think it is 
too much. The people at my age we are children of the war. We do not have the 
demands to a crisis as young people have. My grandchildren say that it's hard for the 
kids.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",1,I was infected we found a way
United States,"I am 62 years. I have had minks since 83 together with my brother. I started 
working with my uncle in 77, when I left school. I have actually been working with mink 
since 77 as far as I remember. It was until around a year ago. I have two grown children. 
I was divorced in  7. Now I live together with someone else. I live in a small city in 
Northern Jutland. Corona means that I'm not allowed to have mink anymore. I have 
another job now as a truckdriver. Most of the year I was alone with the mink s. The minks 
were infected right up to the weekend. On Saturday I could see it on the minks. I was 
also tested positive  on that Monday. The day after they came from the Danish Veterinary 
and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen) and tested my mink. They were all positive 
(the tests). During the next 10 -12 days it ran through the farm. The 1st of October (2020) 
they did t ests again for antibodies, from the University of Copenhagen. They didn't have 
the virus anymore. There was an increased mortality during that week in the farm. If there 
were any weak ones they were taken there. There was absolutely not more mortality than  
normally. I had symptoms for two days and then it was over. The minks had symptoms 
for two -three days. It took some days to go through the farm. The brown ones were more 
affected by the virus. They stopped eating for some days. After October 1st things were 
running normally at the farm again. We were told that we could continue as normally 
with creating fur and breeding, but that was changed around 3 or 4 November. We 
started putting them down on the 6th of November. That was exactly the time we should 
have started creating fur. That was the worst part. I had a farm were the infection had  
already passed. Someone helped me with putting them down. He had not been infected 
before and he didn't get infected by putting them down. My farm was not at risk of 
infecting anyone. I thought it was a waste of resources. A Romanian man helped me. 
'''They must be crazy'' he said. Because the minks were in good shape. The veterinarian 
and a professor from the University of Copenhagen told me that the risk of mutation was 
very small. In my opinion it was a political decision and not based on facts. They said t hat 
50 % of the infected in Northern Jutland were infected with the mink variant. But if they 
only tested people with close relations to the mink farms then it would of course be 50 
% of them with the variant. They were looking for the infected ones with t he mink 
variants. After I closed down the farm I had a course in how to drive a truck and then I 
got a job driving a truck. '''It affected me mentally. I was shaken up. They visited more 
times from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. There were al so a few 
soldiers here, when we were putting them down. They sat and looked. I could sense that 
the employees were becoming more and more angry. One of them told me that the 
mink farmer she was with before me, he cried from when she came and until she left .'' 
The other mink farmers were affected by it all again, when everything came up with the 
text messages. Some were very affected by it. I wasn't that affected by it. It helped me to 
get another job. But some days ago, when I had to do some renovations on t he farm, I 
thought it would be nice to have mink again. It's what I'm passionate about. If we didn't 
want to put the mink down, we were at risk of getting the public against us. If a mink farm 
was infected, then the mink farmer could not put the mink down by himself. I had to wait 
until they came. When they finally came the infection was over. If they had relied on the 
information from Copenhagen University maybe the mink wasn''t  put down. I think that 
the National Institute for Disease Control (Statens Seru m Institut) was told that they had 
to say that the mink should be put down. They used the mutation as a reason for putting 
the mink down, but it was already gone, when they were put down. My wife worked at a 
care home;  she might have taken the virus with her home. '''I think I will continue to drive 
a truck until I retire.''","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",0,I was alone with the mink s
United States,"My name is Diana, I am 44 years old and I live in Mid -Jutland. I work at the 
Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen). I have two children, one is 13, he turned 13 on 
Friday and one that is 6. I am alone. I think it has been hard. We have been sent home a 
lot. I have been home, all in all, for 8 months. It has been hard. At one time the big one 
was also home from school and Michelle was home in the beginning of the corona time. 
So I had Michelle home from kindergarten, she was 4 and then I had Christi an home 
from school and then I had work. So I felt that I was max pressured in terms of being 
enough in all areas. If it wasn't Michelle pulling me in the one arm, it was Christian having 
trouble getting on his school stuff and figuring out what he had to do or shouldn't do. 
And then there was work where there were expectations. I think it has been hard. At one 
point I completely lost motivation. I sort of felt that nothing mattered, because I wasn't 
doing enough anywhere. I felt I was running around in my own bubble. The only contact 
I had was with my sister, my father and my brother. At that time I was starting to think 
that I didn't want to continue, now it was simply too much. I might as well stop, because 
I was not enough anywhere. I thought it was hard . It affected my mood, my energy and 
the general feeling of being able to do things. I didn't feel like I had energy to do 
anything. It was just a nightmare. I contacted my manager, because I have been down 
with stress before and it was those kind of sympt oms that I was starting to feel again. 
They were returning. I felt that no matter what I did I was insufficient everywhere. I was 
allowed to go to the office even though we were sent home. It was approved by the  
 
deputy director, because if not I wouldn't have been allowed to go in. I was allowed to 
go in together with another colleague, so there was something outside of these four 
walls, where I just sat staring into the air. That made a difference. It helped. It was hard. 
The teams meetings and everything we had during the time it didn't give me any thing. 
Even if I could sit and talk with my colleagues, it didn't give me what it gave me to get 
away from home. Sitting at home constantly took my peep away. It was strenuous . Just 
getting out and being able to sit at my office, it made a huge difference. We had to show 
the good example, because we are a public agency. I felt that I was being punished. If 
the others could go physically to their office, because it's just a reco mmendation, then 
why couldn't we. That was hard for me to accept. We are actually also people, even 
though we work in public affairs. One time I had to throw away everything that I was 
working on to help my son with his schoolwork. My own work had t o be put aside again. 
The teacher wasn't replying when my son asked. I had to contact the school and tell them 
that if teachers were supposed to be available they had to be there. I sort of had all of 
the roles. I was supposed to be the teacher, I was supp osed to be the mom, I was 
supposed to be the pedagogue and I was supposed to be an employee at the same 
time. I thought it was hard juggling these roles. In one way I had to be the loving 
caregiver, in another way I had to be the person to say that they ha d to sit quietly and at 
the same time I had to be the creative one giving my daughter something to do that she 
could sit with on her own. And then I had to work at the same time. I think it has been 
hard. I'm happy it's all over soon. When we were working online, no one could put their 
camera on, because it would make the connection too slow or cause problems in other 
ways. There was no one where I could say: you have to take over here, they don't want 
to do anything and they are not listening. It became a vicious circle and then I became 
this angry person. No matter what they said or did I was about to rip their heads off in 
the end. I thought: now they just had to stop, it couldn't be right. I also had to pull the 
break and say I don't know what to do. I r eached out to my dad and said '''do something, 
I don't have anymore energy, I don't know how to act, I just get angry with them all the 
time''. It wasn't very fun. It wasn't the type of mom that I wanted to be. With my employer 
I felt, I will do what I have t he time to do, but with my children I felt insufficient. I felt that 
no matter which strings I tried to pull, I didn't really feel sufficient. I had no more tools to 
use. In particular I remember one episode, where my boy came and told me: '''Mom, you 
are fr eaking angry all the time. You are just scolding''. That was the last drop. I then 
thought that I didn't want this. I'm not interested in being the mom that is just scolding, 
as soon as they open their mouths. Both me and my children are vaccinated. All thr ee of 
us have had corona at our home. My son had cold symptoms, my daughter didn't have 
any symptoms and I was really sick for 14 days, with coughing, shortage of breath and a 
sore throat. I didn't expect that I would have been hit so hard, when I recently  had taken 
the third vaccine. Why did I have to take it, when I was hit so hard? I still cough and get 
a shortage of breath, when I walk up the stairs. Whenever my pulse increases,  I cannot 
breathe.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",0,"these four walls, where I just sat"

higher risk or what they chose to call it. My old mom at 93 is va ccinated, my children and 
grandchildren are not vaccinated, but the rest of my family is vaccinated. I'm alone a lot 
of the time. I choose not to be around people that much. The people that were in my 
bubble were my children and my neighbors that I am used  to seeing. My mom has 
dementia, so I had a lot to do with her. There's something about keeping your head in it 
and not taking your head under your arm and following the principles of carefulness with 
masks. I am not one of those with a tin paper hat. But being sensible and then get tested 
in the contexts, where it was required, when I had to go to examinations. My daughter 
and her children had corona at some point. Of course I didn't see them, but I had seen 
them shortly and therefore I was nervous... or n ot nervous, but extra attentive to whether 
there was something. And I didn't visit my mom before I had taken two tests, so I was 
certain about not being infected and I wasn't infected. I also did a lot of things to 
strengthen my immune system and I live re latively healthy. I still have clients. I have 
worked online for more than 20 years, because  I have worked with education in the 
Middle East and other places, in Sri Lanka after the Tsunami. So I have been used to 
making treatments online. So all of this online stuff was not hard for me, so I also 
continued to work and have clients. The courses I  had to go to in Sweden they were 
online, because some were worried about corona. One of the things that made me really 
angry was that it became like a dictatorship  even though they said that it was voluntary  
(to get the vaccine). It was like they made an a - and a b -team. That was something that 
affected me. Right there I became damn angry. It didn't impact how often I saw my 
children and grandchildren. I was also close with them. I also got tested before visiting 
the ones in Copenhagen. My grandchildren are in school and at the schools they were 
very attentive to limiting the spread of the disease. If I have been with someone and I 
know that they are tested, I am not going to get tested. It's not like I am test ing myself all 
the time. I couldn't travel to visit my husband that was also a thing. I have not discussed 
or preached. It's important to me that people make an independent decision. We have 
exchanged point of views. I had one friend that was very hysteric al - she was very scared 
of becoming infected. When she came to visit me of course I tested myself, but she also 
insisted that we wore masks, when we were close together. That lessened as the general 
hysteria in society was lessening. She just came here ag ain. She was here for a week. 
There was an insecurity about my grandchildren being infected, so we also kept a 
distance and wore masks. I have a decreased lung capacity, it is one of those things that 
I have. When I go shopping I still wear a face mask in order to protect myself. But I could 
have done that without corona, it is because of my lungs and people could have the flu. 
At one point I stopped watching TV, because I felt that the language in the press 
conferences was blaming the unvaccinated people f or the disease spreading. Then 
someone showed some numbers that both vaccinated and unvaccinated were equal 
carriers  of the disease. It gave me feelings about a totalitarian government. At one point 
I talked to an unvaccinated friend. We had to be careful, we were discussing whether we 
would have access to treatment, because we are not vaccinated. There was this divisio n 
very much in the rhetoric in a very uncomfortable way. There has never been anyone 
critical towards the vaccines speaking in public. I am a part of a group for unvaccinated 
people. There are damn many people with tin paper hats on, I think that is just as bad to 
listen to. My opinion is that I don't doubt there is a lot of money involved in this. The 
medical industry is making a lot of money  on this. In the Facebook group that I am a part 
of for unvaccinated people, someone asked if anyone wanted to talk and wanted to see 
each other, because her children didn't want to see her anymore, because her ex -
husband and children were convinced that s he was wearing a tin paper hat and that she 
was crazy and all sorts of things. She was very unhappy. She then came to live here for a 
few days. She was very scientific about researching the vaccines. Her sources were 
scientifically valid. I didn't know her  before, but we are still friends. It was very important 
for her to make friends. There were many people in that group that had troubles with 
friends and family.","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",3,"part of for unvaccinated people, someone asked"
United States,"My name is Sara and I am 24. I just moved to Aalborg a month ago. I am 
studying social pedagogy. I was on a vacation in Spain in July -August of 2021 together 
with my former boyfriend and some friends. When we came home and landed in the 
airport I could fee l that I felt bad and so did my boyfriend. So we took a corona test to 
check if there was anything and we were positive both of us. My former boyfriend, 
Michael, was only sick for a day and a half and then he started to be well again. But that 
wasn't completely the case with me. It started with me feeling nauseous and throwing 
up. It then became worse and worse. When I hit day 6 I couldn't really wear clothes, 
because my body was so soar. I couldn't stand and shower. I couldn't lie in the bed or 
be anywhere, because I felt so sick. I had a very bad headache, so I couldn't be in the 
light. When I woke up I couldn't breathe... I completely couldn't breathe. It felt like 
someone was standing on my chest and I couldn't get air properly into the lungs.  It 
actually became so bad that I called 911, because my nails and toes were completely 
blue. It took an hour before the ambulance came, while I was lying there. In the hospital 
they could see that my pulsometer  was not the way it should be, so they gave me oxygen. 
When I came back home it was like it was continuing, and I actually think that I could 
breathe after that. I think that because I suffer from panic anxiety, it made my corona 80 
times worse than it was . I thought that when I was standing it would  be worse, so I started 
crawling, when I had to go pee and crawl if I had to get something to eat. So I lost 9 kilos, 
because I just lied in bed and couldn't eat and then I stopped sleeping and had a major 
crisis situation after this. I started calling the  doctor from the emergency service every 
night, I called 911 all the time. Every time they picked me up, my values were just fine. I 
could easily breathe, I could easily catch my breath. They listened to my lungs and I could 
easily take in the air I needed  to. There were actually no big problems, but my anxiety 
kept trying to convince me that I was still sick from corona and never would become well 
again. It was like that for 2 -3 months, where I couldn't even go outside the door or go 
out in the backyard. I  was just lying in my bed. I had to call in sick at my study. And then 
I actually started to feel better again in December. I am still registered as sick, but I will 
start again soon. Before I was infected I was not scared of it at all. It is a bit funny, because 
I have the illnesses of disease anxiety and panic anxiety. But I was not at all scared about 
 corona. I mean of course I kept a distance and used hand sanitizer, but I did not take it 
seriously, when the media was reporting on corona and when they said how many died 
and were very sick. As a pedagogue I still went to work, so I don't feel like it affected my 
everyday life until I was positive. I was in a residential institution, so peopl e had to be 
there all the time. When I first started we wore masks, so I don't think they really knew 
how I look and we had to sanitize and keep a distance. It was re ally hard as a pedagoue 
because you have to care for the people you are with, and not being able to touch them 
was really hard. The school was shut down for a long time. From December 2020 to June 
2021, we only had online classes. I feel my anxiety is even  worse now, because we have 
physical classes and it's been such a long time. You haven't been social and had a normal 
everyday life, it has at least triggered something in me. I started seeing a psychologist 
working in the psychiaty in October. I had to le ave my apartment in Copenhagen and 
move to the city and home where my grandparents live, because I needed someone to 
take care of me. After some time we agreed to call the psychiatric department, because 
it was not getting better. It was actually getting w orse, because I suddenly could not get 
out of the door. I had a really good psychologist and started taking medication for my 
anxiety. My former boyfriend that I had been with for two years, he left me, because of 
it. All I could talk about was the illness  and how I felt I was going to die. The people that 
were affected the most are my grandparents that I lived with, because I didn't sleep at 
night. I cried and yelled at them. I came down with stress because of corona and that 
made my heart beat relly fast,  I kept believing that my heart was ill, so I called the 
emergency doctor at all times and my granddad would get up at night to drive me. I 
didn't have any energy to ask my friends how they were doing. I was very dependent on 
my family during that time.","['Education', 'Domestic']",1,"I was standing it would be worse,"
Denmark,"I am Carina, I am 29 years old, almost 30. Right now I live in a small city in 
Northern Jutland. I work as a teacher in a private school in a temporary position, where 
I have a temporary job from a teacher that is on sick leave. For me a lot of different t hings 
have happened during the past two years. Right when corona was on, when Mette 
Frederiksen (prime minister) closed Denmark, then I was actually writing my master 
thesis at the university and was finished with that in a weird constellation. We actually 
didn't know if we would be able to go to the exam and because of that it was a chaos 
when all graduates were done that summer. '''It was simply the worst, oh it was 
depressing and I was actually close to having a depression because of it.'' I felt  very 
confused about what I was supposed to do and what I even wanted. At that time I was 
living in Aalborg and I actually had a man as a boyfriend. I had been with him for five 
years and I had lived with him for three years. It was very hard finding a job . There were 
no places they would let you in. It was almost impossible getting in contact with anyone. 
'''I also experienced that the job center was very pressured. They didn't really know what 
they would use all of those graduates for.'' For instance I exper ienced that my degree 
was undermined, for instance the first meeting I had with the job consultant, they said 
that was not the best combination you could have chosen and I was like '''see, now I have 
just spend five years of my life, don't start telling me t hat.'' I have a master's degree in 
English and Media Science. It's easier if they have a person that they know is an engineer. 
It was a little like within the human sciences you were stepped on a little bit. '''What the 
hell do you tell yourself, choosing som ething that is so open and wasn't easy making use 
of.'' In the summer things were open, but in the winter everything closed down. It was 
very isolating and I also think that I started to think, what am I doing. '''I don't really feel 
like being with this guy and I feel like half of what I am.'' My family felt that I was slowly 
disappearing into myself and it actually reached a point where my parents said, '''you 
need to come home now''. And then I came home in January and have actually been 
with my parents around a year to get back to myself first of all, but also come back to my 
family, because in that relationship many of the things that I care about doing I stopped 
doing, because I thought I was supposed to do that. What happened while I was here, 
was that we we re not right together. '''And to be honest I also feel that there is a reason 
why I was so unhappy. I don't feel like I fit in in a heterosexual  relationship. And I don't 
feel comfortable in the role as a traditional woman. I really feel like I shrunk in a way to 
nothing. '''And that just made life too hard and limiting. I actually had to figure out what 
was going on, because up to that point I had just thought I was bisexual. And I had 
thought that since I was, let me think back, 17 I think.'' Then spring 2021 came and 
Denmark started opening up again. I was still a bit upset and had to figure out who I am 
and what the hell I want to do and who do I want to be and how do I feel. '''Do I want to 
be in a relationship right now or do I just want to be myself? And I h ad to figure out the 
shame I had, I'm actually not into men I am into women. Does that mean I am trans for 
example? Am I a man in a woman's body? And I was like, no not really.'' I just think the 
 
 
   124 
 
idea of the traditional feminine woman in high heels and lipstick and long hair and 
dresses. I feel that that is not right for me, that meant I also had to make space for being 
a woman can be more things. A woman does not have to be like the women from 
Hollywood. I don't need to be saved, I can save myself. It required some soul searching . 
I can be a woman and like women. It doesn't mean that I am trans or that I need to change 
things about myself. Some days were easy and some days were hard. This was the r esult, 
now I had to accept it. I've found strategies to satisfy this part of myself. I am on dating 
apps and have found friends that I meet. They opened an LGBT bookshop in Aalborg. 
It's a very open -minded place. This place has created a culture in this pa rt of the country. 
It's like a sanctuary. In the summer of 2021 I got a job. I felt more free and cut my hair 
short. Some react fiercely when they see me. I have had some uncomfortable comments. 
I was working at a coffee shop and my colleague told me that if I was to be reincarnated, 
I would be so as a man. I thought he was being transphobic and really rude. '''And then I 
chose for the first time in my life to say, '''you know what, I am feeling pretty cool, I am a 
lesbian.'' He became very pale, it was funny. I  ended up working in the school where I 
am now. I had to figure out how to be queer in a professional context. It's a part of myself 
that I don't want to hide. We do not have a lot of LGBT adults in this area, most people 
move to Aarhus or Copenhagen. The older children were asking me if I had a girlfriend 
or boyfriend. I felt I was not their friend, but their teacher. In the 9th grade they had 
sexual education and they were asking me all different kinds of questions. I thought I 
might as well teach them ab out it. Someone had a transwoman in their family and asked 
if that was weird. We talked about gender identity, LGBT and pronouns. They were very 
quiet and I think they got a lot out of it. I told them coming out was a big thing and they 
should not tell it to others if someone comes out in front of them. I came out to them and 
it has been going fine. I had a colleague who asked  me if I wanted a t -shirt from the pride. 
I feel more like myself than I have done before in my life. '''I think corona fast -forwarded 
that process . It's scary to think about that it had to take a pandemic, but apparently I had 
to reach the bottom to figure out who I was and also to say life is too fucking short to 
pretend to be someone you are not.'' A lot of the women and non -binary peop le I met 
have come out during corona. It has been like a period of reflection. In school we were 
also impacted by covid, with a lot of testing and everyone became sick including myself. 
I was worried about carrying the disease home to my parents and other family members 
with illnesses. Having covid made it hard for me to breathe, I couldn't run like I used to 
do.","['Identity', 'Domestic']",1,I was slowly disappearing into myself and
Somalia,"I am 19 years old and I attend a high school in Odense and I come from 
Somalia. I am doing a two year high school degree. In the beginning I was worried that 
it would affect our everyday lives and that it would affect my family. It also did. I couldn't 
play football with my friends. In February or March (2020) I was in 9th grade and we 
heard something about the school was going to close. It became online. I was not happy 
about it. '''It was in the end of the 9th grade when you have gone to school for a long 
time, it was in the end and you were supposed to have fun and stuff. We were supposed 
to go to Copenhagen, but we didn't do that after corona came. '' It has ruined some 
things for me. The school was closed down, then it opened up and then it closed down 
again. '''It made me angry, because you can't just close, open, close, open. '' In 10th grade 
it was also the same. I was afraid that it had affected my grades. So I was not that fond of 
them clo sing and opening and closing again. They should either have closed all the time 
or opened all the time. It has made the days so boring and the days so slow. I couldn't 
go out to play football. Nothing but being at home and worrying about whether you 
were h it by corona. '''My mom was hit by corona and that also affected me a lot. '' One 
day I was out with her in the city and she got hit by corona. I didn't know. I was with her 
all day. '''When I found out I thought corona kills people and things like that. It just  made 
me worry more. When she was sick, we all had to stay at home until we had a negative 
test. We didn't get it anyways. I didn't get corona, but my brother and dad had it. '' It just 
made it worse. It was hard going out and getting tested again or buy something from 
the supermarket for the family. You were worried about being hit by it and not being 
able to see it. And also infecting others, if you got hit. I didn't get corona . Now, if my 
brothers get infected I don't worry about it, because I am used to i t now. I thought I could 
have done better in 9th grade, but I didn't, so I took 10th grade. In 10th grade my grades 
were a lot better even if corona was there. If you had a few cold symptoms, or allergy, I 
have allergy sometimes, you could see that people would move away from you. People 
thought you had corona and you had to get tested all the time. You had to get tested 
every other day to go to school. If you didn't get tested before school, you couldn't go. 
My friends and I had a good bond before. We are not as close as we were before, but 
we still talk. Now we just remember how it was before. If corona had not been there it 
might have been different. We have become too used to staying at home and playing 
play station or studying. We don't really go out anymore like we did before corona. We 
are just used to being home right now. Maybe it's every other month we go out now. 
Before we went out almost every day until 10 or 11 o'clock. After corona came and 
footbal l closed down, I came in bad shape and it was hard for me to start again. Not 
being able to hug and keeping a distance and using hand sanitizer all the time also 
impacted my time in school. We couldn't visit our family, our cousins, or they came to 
our pla ce. It hasn't happened that often these two years, so we spoke on the phone or 
wrote to each other instead. My brother also played play station with them. I wasn't born 
here, I came here in 2013. It has been very hard. I made extra homework because I 
could n't speak proper Danish. My mom always helped me. I don't think I would have 
gone to high school without my mom.","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,was in 9th grade and we heard
United States,"''I am a 46 -year -old woman who lives in a small village in the Estonian 
countryside (although we also have an apartment in the city where I used to work). I not 
married but live in a long -term relationship. My partner has no steady income: he makes 
some mone y from occasional commissions but mostly spends his time maintaining our 
country property, an old farm inherited from my grandparents. I am and always have 
been the main breadwinner of the family. This has at times been a source of tension, but 
we have rea ched a pragmatic peace in the years that we have been together. I have 
higher education, my partner vocational education. We have no children.  
I had worked in the import -export sector for almost twenty years, having established a 
secure position in a company but I left, because the owner''s erratic decisions threatened 
the customer base that I had developed over years. The undoing of my work was v ery 
frustrating. At the beginning of the pandemic, I was employed by an international 
company but most of my work was conducted long -distance. The company closed last 
year and all of the staff was fired, including me. I have been a freelancer since then, 
working on unpredictable small projects that bring in some income but nothing 
comparable to my previous salary that exceeded the Estonian average considerably. We 
are managing, however, as I have some savings and we have always lived frugally. 
Although my l ife is now almost as precarious as that of my partner, I am able to take 
interest in my local community affairs and I have even been invited to join the local 
government of the small rural parish in which we live. I know that as a woman nearing 
middle age who has worked all through her life I should be more afraid about my 
economic future, but I am confident that the diminished income I make is sufficient for 
us. If necessary, we can rent out our city apartment.  
 
The whole situation thus, oddly, is not depressing but somehow liberating. The old job 
was well -paid but very stressful: my immediate boss was making management mistakes, 
communication was poor and the schedule was unpredictable. The management culture 
was unhealthy psychologically, as the manager refused to accept his mistakes and 
instead unfairly blamed staff. Thus the pandemic came as something of a relief, as the 
office staff all had to transfer to distant work. Communications, oddly, got better. The 
pandemic also reduced the need of unpredictable travel and allowed me to ground 
myself better and understand that I wanted to leave the job even before the company 
was closed. The pandemic was a wake -up call. I lost in income, but I have lost the stress 
that has been making me angry for years.  
 
Although most people feel depressed about the pandemic, this has not been a major 
issue for us: we live most of the time in the country and thus are isolated from other 
people anyway. Of course, for somebody used to a high -stress job and international 
 
 
   128 
 
travel, the eventless routine is also hard at times: on many days, the major excitement is 
walking 3 km to the local library, where I have set up an office to have a reason to leave 
our house. One also gets tired of cross -country skiing and running. We meet our family 
and friends, but we have cut down on our social contacts as you never know who  has 
been where. My partner, because he has been living in the countryside, is not 
vaccinated ''not because he does not believe in vaccines but because he believed he 
was so far from crowds for the first year of the pandemic as to not be in danger or be a 
danger to others. Now feels that he is stigmati ded and this does not increase his desire 
for vaccination. This has been a source of some tensions with friends. I got vaccinated at 
the very beginning of the vaccination drive in Estonia and I was among the first, thus, to 
also get the booster. This imbala nce in our vaccination status and this has made it harder 
to do things that he also likes: like seeing our old friends who live abroad or even go to 
a spa with our extended family. But we make do, one day at a time. There is a lot of 
poverty in the countryside and we are relatively well off here: so many people live off 
benefits only and it would be unethical for us to com plain.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",0,46 -year -old woman who lives
Germany,"''I am a 38 -year -old Estonian man and I live in a small Estonian town, but 
regularly visit a bigger city where I am completing a postgraduate degree. I used to live 
in the town where I study but I gave up my apartment during the pandemic, to save on 
rent. A ll courses were online anyway and thus it did not seem to make sense to spend 
the money, especially since I am living on a limited budget. I have steady, but small, 
income as a postgraduate student, but in Estonia we have to pass an annual perfo rmance 
review to maintain the income. Although people around me are very supportive, the 
atmosphere of constant competition creates a lot of stress.  
 
Another source of stress is the atmosphere of, if not exactly intolerance, then at least a 
lack of acceptance for difference: as a gay man, I am used to not talking about my life 
with people I do not know. I am not hiding it but I also do not want to share  too much 
information. The situation is complicated, as there is a big generational difference: while 
people in their 20s tend to be accepting of gender diversity and very open about their 
identity choices, this topic is very hard to even talk about with p eople over 60 who were 
 raised under Soviet regime where homosexuality was criminalized. Mostly people avoid 
the topic, but there is also casual intolerant commentary and jokes in the media but also 
on the streets, especially late at night when drunk people leave bars. Although I have 
not been a victim of violence, I have friends who have been attacked for lookin g 
different. You do not even have to be gay to be attacked! The attitudes seem to be class 
based: university students are accepting of difference but when one leaves the b ubble, 
one meets people with less education who see the increasing tolerance in our society as 
a threat. It is not just about sexuality, although gays and especially trans people are often 
targets of violence. One learns to avoid certain kinds of groups on  street at night by 
reading their clothes and body language. These stresses add up and made Estonian life 
seem quite toxic even before the pandemic.  
 
The Covid -19 pandemic did not initially have such a huge impact on me as I am not that 
social anyway and thus the closing of bars, restaurants, gyms and other similar facilities 
did not seem that big a deal. I was able to take long walks: oddly, as city centers emp tied 
out, different nature walks around the city were very crowded. Things got worse when I 
had an injury that prevented me from walking and this indeed made my mental health 
get worse. This is odd to say, perhaps, but I was fortunate in already having a psychiatrist  
and thus access to medications, while I know many people had to wait for months to get 
access to even most basic mental health consultations. I felt bad but I had help at least.  
However, the crisis did create a pervasive fear and anxiety that was contagious and that 
added to my own pre -existing anxiety issues. The situation was made worse by the 
blatant way in which the government and the opposition used the pandemic for political  
gain. They explicitly showed that staying in power was more important than people''s 
mental and economic wellbeing and health. Not that I had illusions about community 
spirit and kindness, but it was still disheartening to see the flourishing of individual ism. I 
also cannot understand why the state was so inefficient in the distribution of masks and 
tests. I really cannot understand by the rapid tests have to be 410 times more expensive 
in Estonia than in Germany or the Netherlands. In the latter, students and teachers have 
access to free tests. And Estonians are so much poorer.  
 
It is also very depressing to look at the selfishness of so many Estonians: if people do not 
believe in masks or vaccines, they still should not assume that they have the right to 
endanger the lives of more vulnerable people in society. There are ways of g etting 
around, without putting others at risk, especially in Estonia where there are so many 
online services and e -commerce solutions. This, of course, is not an Estonian problem 
alone. It is just that the atmosphere in Estonia is often so unfriendly and t his makes it 
hard to operate, especially when you are more vulnerable than the average person.",['Education'],1,I was fortunate in already having a
United States,"''I am a 30 -year -old Estonia man living and working as a nurse in one of the 
major hospitals in Estonia. I am not regularly working with Covid -19 patients, but as 
hospitals have cancelled non -emergency care during the different surges of the virus, 
nurses from other departments are recruited to work in the Covid  ward as well. I have 
done my hours in that ward, too. This is not a popular assignment, because of the long 
shifts and the need to work with PPE. At the beginning of the pandemic, people w ho 
agreed to work in the ward were paid double wages but this bonus went away, as the 
situation normalized. Nurses are not happy to volunteer without bonuses because they 
just cannot afford to. I am relatively privileged, but I have many colleagues who hav e to 
take on additional shifts in the ER and other places to make ends meet. The additional 
funding that hospitals were given has not visibly changed the general salary levels 
among nurses and there is therefore a lot of tiredness and many people are think ing of 
changing jobs. There is just too much stress: the heavy work load, the pandemic, the 
responsibility and the workplace atmosphere. I am lucky as in my clinic the atmosphere 
is good: we have an understanding boss who manages people well and we feel li ke 
members of a team but that is not a rule. Nurses, especially, are stressed out as they are 
between the doctors and the patients and have to bear a lot of negative emotion that 
they have not caused.  
The hospital is offering different classes to combat stress and burnout ''but the people 
who need the help the most just do not have time to attend a class! They even do not 
have the chance to go to a spa, even if given a voucher! At the beginning of the 
pandemic different companies donated gifts like these but what my colleagues want is 
a day off, some extra vacation. But with surges in the virus and with so many colleagues 
sick, you have to go in.  
What makes the situation worse is the insensitivity of the society around us. I do not just 
mean the political debate around masks and vaccines ''it is unbelievable that at a time 
when we could ease the suffering of so many people, especially the old and the  
vulnerable, there are political forces who are venting vaccine hesitancy and it works. So 
many people who we could help have been misled and when they get to us, they end 
up in ICU and Covid  patients tend to not return from it. We are mostly vaccinated at  the 
hospital but even we have some outliers. As if our job was not difficult already without 
this. There are so many people who do not understand how hard this job is and are 
making it even harder with their poor people skills. One of my friends did half of her 
internship in Finland and had a culture shock in Estonia, because the friendliness and

United States,"''I am an Estonian woman, 48, who has two jobs: I have a freelance job that I 
love doing and that fills be with a sense of creative achievement and then a job that I 
dislike that guarantees steady monthly income and also health benefits. I am unmarried 
but cohabit with the same man for over 20 years. We have a harmonious relationship 
and have three children. We both work in a sector of the economy where we agreed on 
a 25% pay cut at the beginning of the pandemic, as this is what the company proposed 
so that all of us could keep our jobs. The ay cut was very hard for us, as we are paying off 
a mortgage, but we also wanted to make sure that we get income and maintain our 
health benefits.  
 
During the pandemic, I was also the caregiver of my elderly mother and father. In other 
words, it seems that my whole life has revolved around care in the past three years, with 
very limited outside help. I am ensured in the national health service and so are all my 
family members but it was impossible to secure daycare for my mother when she 
developed Alzheimer''s. There are very few memory care institutions and they are too 
expensive for us. In addition, according to Estonian law the family is responsible for the 
care of the elderly and, well, there are too many people, poorer than us, who are in even 
more dire circumstances. My mother''s decline was very fast: she was very sharp and 
physically active but then her mind went. We had issues with her escaping t he house and 
having to search for her in the city and the challenge of explaining all of this to my own 
children. They were confused by the erratic behavior as well as my exhaustion and 
irritability. My father was also ailing and of no help. It is understa ndable that he was 
frightened by the possibility of memory lapses in himself but he became irritable and all 
this added to the stress. The situation was especially bad under the lockdown as they 
were cut off from all friends and we had to shoulder all care . I am afraid that I neglected 
my own children''s emotional needs at the time: the parent situation was a constant 
emergency and the children were old enough to take care of their school work. Yet the 
level of tension was very high in the house because we h ad no place to escape from the 
stress. We get along fine with the children, but they also were so aware of the tension 
that they stopped sharing their difficulties at school, as they did not want to add to the 
considerable stress levels they knew we had to  bear. I felt very bad as a mother when I 
realized this. But we were left so alone. I guess this also existed before the pandemic, 
but it was during the pandemic especially that all care was just offloaded to families and 
in our age group things can be esp ecially bad as we have school -age children but also

aging parents and the double care duty is just impossible, especially when you have to 
do all of this in your own home. It seemed that there was very little attention to parents, 
but from my perspective the silence about caring for older parents or sick relatives is 
even deeper: you have nowhere to go, unless you are very rich! Different kin ds of 
memory care facilities seemed dangerous, too, as there were mass infections and it 
seemed cruel to send my mother there to potentially get sick and die alone. Doin g what 
we did seemed inevitable. I wish there were some kinds of home health aids like abroad 
who could have given some relief. Or some kind of a support system. I am actually 
relieved that I did not lose my job, because I was doing so much of the care wor k. This 
invisible work should be talked about more. It is only looking back (now that my mother 
passed away) that I realized that I was deeply burned out: when I was taking care of 
everybody else, there was nobody to take care of me, including myself.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,"am an Estonian woman, 48, who has"
United States,"''I am a forty -year -old woman of Russian origin who lives in one of the bigger 
cities in Estonia. My partner is also Russian but we have chosen to raise our children as 
bilinguals to help their future careers. We are not married but we have three children: 
one under one and 2 in primary school. I work in education and my partner in the IT 
sector. We are both proficient in Estonian. We decided to not take any risks at the 
beginning of the pandemic, when there was a lot of confusion about vaccines: while I 
got vaccinated, my husband did not, just in case the vaccines had a bad effect, so that 
one of us would be able to be there for the children. When you have children, you cannot 
take risks.  
Because our third child was still under a year, I was on parental leave when Covid -19 
started and worked only part time. My partner was also able to work from home, but he 
had to spend the whole day in front of the computer and do work.  
The beginning was very hard for my sons as well: when all schools switched to online 
teaching, they had to learn to be more independent and learn to manage their time 
better. This added to my work load, of course, as I had to keep an eye on their electroni c 
school application my cell phone to check whether they had a video lesson or what web 
application they were supposed to use to do some tasks, which work sheets had to be 
printed out and completed, then photographed and sent back to the teacher. At times 
we were supposed to videorecord answers: the technical side was time consuming as 
the children were too small to cope with all of this on their own. The older son had 
 already acquired some independent learning skills and knew when to ask for help, but 
the younger son did not want to ask for help and was often just crying in his room. I 
understand that the teachers were trying very hard to create diverse tasks to motivate 
students and help them learn but all this diversity also put a lot of stress on mot hers, who 
had to be available to help the students. Supervising schoolwork was a full time job even 
for me ''and I work in education!  
Fortunately, this was possible with my own work. I had my own classes in the afternoon, 
when my boys'' school day was already over. If my youngest was not sleeping, the boys 
or my partner were able to play with her and I was able to withdraw into the bedroo m 
and teach from there. I also have a tiny office at home but it does not have a door and 
thus could not be used for my own teaching. Not that the bedroom door helped: my 
daughter stood behind it, crying and demanding my attention. My students got to know 
my family, too. I am now conducting my Zoom seminars from my office and at times my 
daughter hast to sit in my lap. Nothing doing. Like probably all mothers, I sinned by 
letting children watch cartoons to get some work done, instead of taking them out, but  
this does not really work because of disruptions.  
The role division is clear: I have to be mother first and foremost. I have to keep an eye 
on the youngest, on the boys'' homework, make sure all children spend some time 
outside. Pandemic or not, meals have to be cooked, laundry done and ironed. The boys 
help with some of the housecleaning, but the brunt falls on me. At least the rest of the 
family gets out of the house and I do not have to keep an eye on the children during the 
weekly cleaning. The times when I was able to do my own work were very limited: some 
hours when my daughter was asleep or I can read something when I am putting her to 
bed''but it is impossible to type in the dark. There were times when I fell asleep myself 
when putting her to bed and woke up at midnight to do my work for a few hours i n peace 
and quiet. Not that this work was very productive. Getting up before others does not 
work for me, as this also wakes up my daughter and in our family the first person to rise 
also makes breakfast. Since my partner is an early riser, he usually take s care of this.  
Thus, the main adjectives that characterize my life during the pandemic are 
sleeplessness and tiredness. Things got better over time, as we all acquired new skills 
and routines. Naturally I just cut corners with some tasks: if I am too tired to clean, I wi ll 
not do a thorough cleaning, one can also wear unaproned  clothes at home, I rearranged 
my work so I did not have to give so much student feedback. There was a lot of comic 
relief in the pandemic dress code: a formal blouse over sweatpants and slippers, w ith a 
nicer hairdo and some lipstick. The children knew this was the signal that their mother 
was going to work.","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,"I am too tired to clean, I"
United States,"''I am 28 -year old woman from a Western European country who currently 
works in Estonia in the white -collar sector in the largest city. I have worked in Estonia for 
four years on a temporary contract which will end at the end of the year but I have 
secured another temporary contract recently.  I am safe for another five years and I am 
also glad that I do not have to move agai n, as I have come to feel comfortable here. I 
had was on the job market during the pandemic and there was also a lot of competition: 
I sent out many CV -s and did not really get any interviews outside of Estonia. I had 
networked quite hard and was thus disa ppointed. It seems that the competition has got 
tougher, as everybody now knows how to work long distance and employers are also 
more relaxed about people''s physical location. The competition for people in my age 
group really is global. Since I work in an industry where we live from project to project, 
this is also something that makes it hard to plan your life long ahead. My older relatives 
do not get this, as they used to have life -long contracts in the same country. None of 
them, actually, has worked abr oad, while I have been away from my home country since 
my postgraduate studies.  
For work, transition to online life was not that hard at the beginning of Covid -19: there 
was some learning to be done, but in our field, the tools are good and teams adapt. 
However, it was hard for me personally, as it really disrupted my lifestyle. I am not a party -
goer or even very social, but I am an avid amateur athlete and thus  the closure of all 
gyms and other sports facilities made the lockdown very hard. Estonians had their own 
families and they tended to clam up into their little pods and forgot a bout us, foreigners, 
who did not have these pods. It was also at times hard to get adequate information in 
English. My workplace uses English, but this is not the case in society and my own level 
of Estonian is very limited. At least I am a legal immigrant , with all documents and health 
insurance. Fortunately, I have some friends who trusted me and whom I trusted and with 
whom we were able to run and do other outside activities. I think this was OK in Estonia, 
as it is easy to get into nature in even larger  cities. Plus the lockdown was very limited: 
Estonians were on the streets again in May 2020 and although we have had some 
restrictions since then, society has not really been shut down. When you have an 
electronic Covid -19 pass, it is easy to go to movies, museums and cafes, so there is a 
variety even when you do work online for most of the day. This liberal approach at times 
makes me scared, even, as it seems that the general public is not taking the pandemic 
that serio usly even now, when the infection ra tes are high. Restaurants are still full and 
so are gyms ''despite the fact that I fear from my Estonian acquaintances that schools are 
hard hit. I am young and healthy and vaccinated, but it seems that it is just a matter of 
time when we all get it.  
My personal life was horrible, though, because my husband was stuck in Western Europe 
during lockdown and his situation was even worse, because in his country the rules were 
way stricter than in Estonia and he really had to become a hermit and I had to con sole 
him on the phone. When we met again May 2020, after four months, it felt surreal as the 
trip that usually takes under a day took three days, because the usual airlines and train

third country because I was supposed to go in December and then the omicron variant 
emerged and created new hassles for travel ''and I stayed in Europe. It is of course sinful 
to complain as I have a job and I had not serious health issues, but the pandemic has 
really made the life of transnational couples very hard. At least we live in the EU, where 
travel has been relatively easy even during the pandemic. We all rea lly love the airlines 
that kept on flying in the pandemic! People who travelled during the pandemic were 
considered selfish, but the critics forget about the many transnational families who wait 
for each new variant with panic as it might cut them off from  their partners or children.","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",0,than in Estonia and he really had
United States,"''I am an 82 -year -old man of Estonian origin and I live in a small rural 
community. Despite my age, I am relatively healthy, but I try to not move around too 
much, especially in winter when it is slippery to not fall down and hurt myself. When you 
fall and b reak something, it can put you to hospital and this scares me, especially today 
when people get sick in the hospital. My wife, who is almost as old as me, does most of 
our shopping when our children take her to the town. I have never become com fortable 
with all the machines you have to use these days to get out your money or to pay the 
bills. I am glad that I have children and grandchildren who help. I am not sure I would be 
able to cope on my own because I am too old to learn these new tricks. My eyesight is 
getting poor and I am just afraid of making some mistake. I stopped driving a few years 
ago, because I am not confident about my reactions and eyesight. We gave away our 
car''and gas is too expensive anyway. Thus we depend on our children to drive us, but 
fortunately one of them lives close by and so we see somebody most weeks.  
I have vocational education and I worked all of my life as an engineer in a factory that 
has since been closed. It seems that today everybody works in a shopping center, as I 
no longer see the familiar factories or farms of my younger days. The habit of wo rk dies 
hard, though: we still keep a garden plot and we also heat our house with wood and so 
there are small jobs to be done around the house all the time that keep me busy. We 
cope, although neither of us is strong as we would like to be and everything t akes a long 
time. But I do not complain. Many of my old friends have already died, but many of them 
had a drinking problem or did not stay active. I did not even smoke: I tried it during the  
 
compulsory military service but then quit. Physical work also keeps you active. If you do 
not stay active, you really start to decline. I try to listen to radio news every day and watch 
TV. I read the paper when the children bring it around. The grandchildren do not come 
as often as we would like to: when they were children, they used to stay w ith us and it 
would be good to have their company but now they have their own lives and we do not 
want to be a bother.  
 
We no longer have many friends and now we do not really want to see many people 
either because of the pandemic and other viruses, too. There are two of us and we want 
to make sure we will be able to keep each other company. I have not been vaccinated 
becau se we live out of town and do not see anybody: when they started vaccinating 
people and there were shortages, it seemed important to get them to doctors and 
nurses and teachers, not people like myself who are not seeing anybody. We are still not 
seeing any body and thus it has just seemed too much of a bother. It seems easy in cities 
but not in the countryside where we are forgotten. There are too many of us old people 
in villages. So who would I meet who could make me sick? And even if I get sick, I have 
lived a long and good life.","['Healthcare', 'Public Space']",3,"I am relatively healthy, but I try"
United States,"''I am a 19-year -old Estonian who lives in the second largest city of Estonia. I 
am female, but like many people in my social circles, I do not believe in rigid gender 
roles. This is quote typical of people of my age group ''but not society at large. In fact, 
Estonian society h as become scarier during the pandemic. The general anxiety has 
created a fear of difference among certain social groups and legitimated hate speech. 
My parents who are quite liberal are still freaked out whenever I stay out late with my 
friends because the y fear that some nationalist thugs have beaten us up. But I need my 
friends. We keep each other going. I appreciate my friends even more now, after the 
lockdown. I started university this year, but I am still very close with my school friends. It 
has been harder to make new friends now that we sort of seem to move between in 
person and online studies. It is easier to hang out with people to whom I do not have to 
explain myself.  
The pandemic was hard for me. I went to a very competitive school and when we 
transitioned to online learning in 2020, I just crashed. The school had always been 
stressful: demanding teachers, parents obsessed by their children''s success and just very 
little respect for creativity. My parents are not like that but you socialize with your friends 
  
 
families and at times there was this huge culture clash. In any case, when we had to go 
to school, it was easier as the routine helped me and I was able to stay on top of things, 
get my homework and tests done. But when I had to plan my own time during the 
pandemic, when we were online, I realized I had never learned to study on my own or to 
even plan my time. It was also hard to find that motivation when you were stuck in your 
room. I often just fell asleep and tried to catch up at night. It seemed that ou r teachers 
were trying very hard to make themselves feel that they were doing their job, but there 
was just too much independent work. And there was no emotional support. But we 
coped somehow, or we learned to cut corners to cope.  And we had each other on line. 
Looking back it does not seem so bad but it was very tiring at the time. We did a lot of 
catching up over the summer ''partying for the lost months as well. It is hard to be young 
in today''s Estonia even without the pandemic. The culture of success put s a lot of 
pressure on you and older generations call us snowflakes, because we do not remember 
the Soviet time and the poverty of the 1990s. This is not our fault.  We seem to have 
different values, like all of my friends are worried about climate change and are 
vegetarians , but my parents' generation  is still buying large cars. I just wish the society 
were more open and accepting of difference and also of possible failure. I, for example, 
really do not know what I want to do when I graduate. I hate the co rporate sector and I 
am scared of having to work in some supermarket, so I cannot afford to study the 
humanities. I chose social sciences, but now it seems I should have gone to IT.  
I am now going to the university and this sort of makes me appreciate that I learned to 
manage my time a bit under the lockdown as we are expected to be more independent 
and do all the work during the semester, even if not all instructors check on us. At l east 
all of the semester was in classrooms. We all sit in masks and try to practice social 
distancing. We have a few students who do not believe in masks and that is sort of 
creepy, but otherwise my institute has maintained a very relaxed atmosphere. Not a t all 
like in my sister''s school where they keep n moving between online and in -person 
teaching as so many children are sick. Nobody tests us at the university, but of course 
some get sick here too and has to go into isolation. Several of my friends are at  home 
now and I hope that I do not have to stay home next week. This is very bizarre, actually: 
you never know who is going to be in class. People leave for 10 days of isolation, then 
come back, but by that time somebody else is going. I do not know what w ould happen 
if one of the teachers fell ill. Still, it beats being online.","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,I am now going to the university
United States,"''I am Lur, a 33 year  old nonbinary person living in Spain. I am also autistic 
and receive a modest sum of 400 euros a month from the government. I have only 
recently become independent in the past few months. During covid I was living at home 
with my mother who was also disab led and my father. I was unemployed the entire time 
and I was studying to get my high school degree at the Adult''s school. My education was 
completely interrupted because of covid when the schools shut down, and my 
educationa l center made no effort to keep in touch with us students and so I felt very 
lost. '''it was like a nightmare, strange, something completely unreal''.  
 
Living at home was difficult. My parents became very anxious after the confinement. My 
mother who was morbidly obese required much help at home as she couldn''t move 
independently, clean herself independently, and despite my father helping sometimes  
during the day, I was required to take up the majority of her care, especially at night. 
Once confinement was over, my father began leaving the house again and my burden 
increased. This meant that for several months I had very little sleep as I was caring  for my 
mother, and this negatively influenced my mental health. This to me was worse than 
covid itself. I have an older brother who also did not contribute to her care.  
This only added to the fear that I felt due to covid and the restrictions we were made to 
follow. I am very scared of the police and was afraid to run into them the times I did leave 
the house to run errands. They were granted more power than they have in a long time. 
Because of my autism, I am vulnerable to the police. Often my body language and words 
are misinterpreted,  and this is often a cause of police violence towards disabled people. 
People have gotten beaten by police for not being able to explain w hy you''re out of the 
house. In one of the neighborhoods in the city, a young man with a mental disability and 
his mother were beaten by police when he had gone out to the store. I was afraid 
something similar would happen to me, where I would not be able t o explain myself and 
end up in trouble. Because of this I very rarely left the house and became increasingly 
isolated.  
Once things began to open again I restarted my schooling and got my degree. It took 
me some time to be able to readjust. Being autistic, changes in routine are very difficult 
and even my parents had to convince me to leave the house again. I even started h aving 
psychosomatic pains.  I am now trying to get my bachelor''s degree. I don''t have any work

I live and work as a live -in carer for the elderly. Confinement was declared eight days 
after my arrival in Spain. Due to the confinement measures, it took me two months to 
find a live -in care job. In my first job, I only worked four hours per day every day, and the 
family that was paying me offered me to live with the woman I was responsible for, to 
avoid contact with others on my commute. I did not want to lose the job so I spent all 
day at the woman's house, helping another girl who  was working there, even if I only got 
paid four hours per day. I also accepted that offer because at the beginning every time 
I traveled to work I was stopped by the police.  
My next job was as a live -in carer of a 94 -year -old woman. At the beginning, her family 
helped me in providing care, but the son got infected with covid and infected the other 
family members, so I was left alone to take care of the old woman. I spent eight  days 
locked up and isolated, without any support because even though the two of us tested 
negative, nobody could help us. I wanted to go out for a walk but they wouldn't let me. 
Then the lady caught the virus, but she was not isolated in her room, nor did  she use the 
mask. I had to get her up, move her and do the household chores. Nobody cared about 
my health. I tested negative but she took a long time to test negative. I wanted to quit 
my job, giving them notice, but this woman's family wouldn't let me le ave because they 
said they couldn't find anyone to take care of this person being positive, and that I was 
obliged to stay there because I was living with someone who tested positive. I went 
through some very bad months, the whole situation lasted for two months. They put the 
responsibility on me to find someone to replace me before I left the job and I didn't find 
anyone because I didn't want to hide the fact that the older woman had covid. When she 
tested negative, we found someone to replace me. I felt p ractically kidnapped,  and I 
didn't know if they were right. I would have liked to have a phone number to get 
information or  know someone who could advise me on my rights, but I was afraid of 
being reported. We come here to work, but as it is not our countr y... you always feel 
afraid. We, migrants, live a double life: we take care of the elderly here but we also have 
to take care and support our families there.  
Subsequently, I worked in a house,  but they allowed me to work for other families during 
weekends, and with the vaccine, there was no problem.  
Together with other migrant women, we usually go to a telephone booth center to send

money to our families, because we cannot do that through banks. This center has 
become a place to share information, help each other find work, get news about each 
other''s lives and share our experiences. We are a very large group of women.  
I know women whose employers don''t let them go out in the street, meet people from 
other villages, for fear of bringing the Covid  to the house and infecting the elderly 
person. People are more distrustful or think we are not responsible persons, because we 
are migrants. As an immigrant, I feel that if someone says something to me, I can't answer 
or defend myself for fear that they w ill tell on me because of my irregular situation. Now

United States,"''My name is Azuzena, I am 28 years old and I am the technical coordinator 
for the monitoring of human trafficking cases at the foundation where I work, as well as 
responsible for the migration emergency programme. The pandemic has taught us that 
despite the fact that in most areas the world has come to a standstill, prostitution, human 
trafficking and the migration crisis have not stopped. We have been confronted wi th a 
situation that, if already adverse, has been complicated by difficulties added by the 
pandemic, such as freedom of movement, or health conditions. This has been reflected, 
for example, in the transfers of victims of trafficking from the cases that wer e dismantled 
as a result of the inspection in the clubs, or in the vaccination policy in the reception 
centres, where we sometimes felt that the women were treated more like a piece of 
furniture than as subjects of rights. Despite the fact that we were con sidered an essential 
service, we encountered a large number of interventions, despite the confinement, 
which we attended to through the use of new technologies and the telephone, but which 
required us to work more proactively. All this we had to do without  direct support from 
public institutions. Except for some occasional emergency aid and subsidies, the usual 
neglect of this sector by the institutions was compounded by the personal impact that 
  
 
the pandemic had on the workers and the consequent increase in stress. We have felt 
profoundly alone during this period. We have been exposed to risks and situations that 
neither the public institutions nor the state security forces were willing to take on, and 
this led us to personally assume the risk, with what that meant for the team, or to devise 
new strategies so as not to neglect the victims. Our sector lacks specific programmes or 
structures that favour coordination and this has meant that we have ha d to make 
decisions in very complex and urgent contexts, and we really need not only coordination 
mechanisms, but also the development of an umbrella of work or intervention, in which 
all the interventions we make, all the parties involved in the fight aga inst trafficking, have 
a common sense. All of this should be a lesson learned from these years of the 
pandemic: if it is already a complicated context, at any time, this context can become 
even more complicated. So, if we start from a solid working basis, it will be much more 
difficult, that is, easier to adapt to this new situation.  
Moreover, in recent months we have had to deal with new situations, such as the difficulty 
of applying the rules of coexistence required by the pandemic in the centres, as young 
women who were rescued from trafficking situations found themselves locked up in a 
centre or shelter, with very limited mobility, and they identified this as being locked up 
again. They were very affected by the loneliness of having to be without contact and 
were, therefore, more likely to break the housing regulations, but because we are not 
considering that these people are in a situation of particular stress and trauma generated 
by the effects of the pandemic.  
To this situation must be added the migratory crisis in the Canary Islands and the 
difficulties that the pandemic has posed for its management. On the one hand, 
procedures that were previously simpler have been complicated, such as cases of return 
to the c ountries of origin, which have been delayed for a long time due to logistical and 
international issues, border closures, etc. In addition, we have detected an increase in 
the number of arrivals of women and women with minors. The coordination of the 
Minist ry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration has greatly facilitated the 
management of this crisis, but it has been oriented, above all, towards guaranteeing the 
right to health.  
In the face of these difficulties, I would like to highlight a very positive fact, which is the 
great adaptability and willingness of all my colleagues. We have needed to 
communicate a lot, create meeting spaces and we have supported each other and 
shared what worked for each of us. This ability to adapt and this communication between 
us has allowed us not only to manage and support each other in the face of this feeling 
of loneliness and lack of protection but also to identify and implement initiatives tha t we 
had not thought of until now and that could have continuity in a post -pandemic context.","['Workplace', 'Education']",2,"cases at the foundation where I work,"

people with health problems. Besides, they do not live in the surrounding areas, which 
is why I cannot count on their support. I don't have much help. The pandemic has made 
it very difficult for those of us who worked without a fixed and stable contract. This type 
of work was my only source of income and with the  pandemic I have found myself in 
precarious situations, with no money left to cover our necessities. There is an association 
in the place where I live that helps vulnerable people like myself. We have survived 
thanks to their constant help. They gave us no n-perishable food and something fresh 
once a week, so that we could have some basics in order to survive. The lockdown period 
was an uncertain and lonely phase, where the only thing that kept me alive was my 
daughter. I had a very hard time, suddenly I fou nd myself with a child without being able 
to go out. My apartment had no terrace or balcony, it was exasperating. My daughter 
spent the whole day looking out of the window, restless. When we could leave the house 
to go shopping, I had to take the child wit h me, but how could I take such a little girl to 
do the shopping? Because of her age, she is very active, she moves a lot and touches 
everything. I felt I could not handle the situation of going to the supermarket with her. I 
turned to the neighbor upstair s for help, she was nice. When I needed food, I asked her 
to please take care of the child while I went to do the shopping. I could not do the same 
  
 
thing with the neighbo urs downstairs, they were not very cooperative, they could not 
stand the noise we made. I felt terribly lonely. I missed the help of different institutional 
agents who should have been more involved with vulnerable groups such as mothers in 
charge of minors. Also, external help that would have helped me with my daught er. She 
is still experiencing difficulties because of the lockdown, problems in her day to day life 
such as behavioral problems and changes in her sleep schedule. I didn't  know what to 
do to calm her down and try to normalize her days.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",0,I felt I could not handle the
United States,"''I am a 44 -year -old Moroccan woman, I have been in Spain for almost 11 
years. I was working as live -in carer, first six years with a family and  then I moved to 
another region for three years until I decided to change my life and try to start a family. 
In October 2019, I married a Moroccan man, who has been in Spain for 14 years. In 
December we rented a flat in a small town.  We chose it because the rents are lower. I left 
my job as live -in carer on February 28, 2020,  and went living in the new home alone, 
because my husband was working in another town at the time. And suddenly the 
confinement due to the pandemic came and I found myself alone, without a job, in a flat 
that had nothing at all and in a town where I didn't know anyone. I had a very bad time. 
The house had nothing, we didn't have time to paint it or buy curtains. We only had a 
plate and a spoon. '''I had a prepaid mobile. It broke down. To buy another one or to 
repair it, I don't know anyone (...) I was very scared. I spent all week without talking t o 
anyone until my husband came over the weekend ('') I thought that with this Covid we 
were all going to die. I'm going to die. And who do I call?''  
I couldn't contact my  family in Morocco and I couldn't talk to anyone. My husband told 
me not to go out on the terrace, because the covid is transmitted through the air. When 
there was the public applause at 8 o'clock I went out to see people, so as not to feel so 
alone. It's just that I was short of breath ('') And sometimes, at night, I would sit in bed 
until the next day, because I was so scared.  
 
Covid has changed my character. I was a happy woman and now I am sad. I am another 
person, although little by little I am recovering. After the lockdown, I got a job at a lady's 
house, I go for two hours two days a week. This woman has given me trust, because now 
I know who to turn to if something happens to me. The girl has given me wor k and has 
also given me hope. I already have someone to call if something happens to me. Before, 
I had no one to turn to. She is the first person I talked to in town. I thin k I've been lucky.  
We have been able to furnish the house and have crockery, sheets, towels and curtains 
because of the death of the mother of some friends of the lady I looked after. They told 
me that they were going to sell the empty house and that I could take whatever I wanted 
because they were going to throw it away, I was embarrassed to ask and I told them this 
I also want, but they told me, we are going to throw it away. So, we took a lot of things. 
It came in handy for us.  
And now we have almost everything, so we can't complain. My husband is now without 
a job and his unemployment benefit has run out, but he receives the subsidy. I would 
like to work a few more hours, but it is not a good time to find other jobs yet.  
The friends I have are because of work. They are the relatives of the women I have cared 
for, who have since died, but the families continue to worry about me. In the town I don't 
interact with anyone, I don't have friends from here. You can't go down the street, and 
connect [with people], just like that.  
I met my husband at a police station, when he was processing the change of residence. 
I didn't want to feel alone and I wanted to relax a bit. Share the responsibilities, but my 
husband has no studies and, in the end, everything falls on my shoulders. My f riends tell 
me that I've gone from worrying about myself to worrying about both of us, but it is what 
it is. I didn't have much of a choice either. I got married so I could live my own life. I was 
tired of being alone. I'm older, I no longer have the abili ty to care for somebody. I need 
to feel alive. If you live in other people's houses you live their life, or you live for them. 
And I decided to make a family. And I would like to be a mother, but at my age they told 
me I would have to go to a private gynecologist,  and we don't have money. Maybe I''ll 
do that later.  
I have a university degree, a Bachelor's degree in Arabic, and when there are public 
examinations in Morocco, I have applied, but they don't call me. I have never requested 
the homologation of the degree in Spain. I don't know how to do it or what to pay and I 
give up. But I'd like to do it.  
I have not experienced racism in Spain, the people I have met have treated me very well. 
Only one woman has treated me badly and made me see that racism does exist. It was 
the primary care doctor, an older woman, who made me feel very bad. This doctor has 
treated me as if I were not a person.  
I don't see my future in Morocco because starting from scratch would be very 
complicated and I'm already old, the family that I have in Morocco (two sisters and three 
brothers) live with their families and they live with minimum resources. I haven't been t o 
Morocco for four years. Not only because it is not possible to go, but because 
economically we can't go either. ''","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",1,"I have not experienced racism in Spain,"

bar because my husband had lost his job, and told him I found him a job.  
My mother always lived in our house and took care of everything. In the village, they say 
that there was a '''matriarchy '' because men spent a lot of time at sea while women were 
in charge, but we also worked a lot. '''Men had their life, their jobs, their friends. They 
came home, and they always found the meal cooked. My husband used to live with

I have been a very happy woman, but I have also experienced sad things. My brother 
died at a young age, my father died too... '''but we have helped each other,  and

When they ask me how the Covid -19 pandemic has affected me, I have to tell the truth, 
it has not affected me, I continue to live my life: I haven''t stayed at home, I had my friends, 
everything turned out well for me. I am concerned about what is happening in the world 
and I comply with all the rules, but personally, it has not affected me. '''I feel fine, I live my 
life: I get up, take a shower and do some odd jobs ''. '''I''m not missing anything, I live life 
on a whim, I can't ask for more. I help as much as I c an at home, I cook a little. Last year 
we could not celebrate Christmas, but it''s fine. We will celebrate another day. You need 
to comply with the rules, wear the mask, not go to places you can't go to ''.

I am very lucky and I can count of the support of my wonderful family. I live with my son 
with disability, and my eldest daughter joined us, since she lost her job due to the 
pandemic. My other daughters live in the same building, so I am never alone. '''I have a 
wonderful family, they all help me, the grandchildren too ''.  
In 2020, during the hardest confinement, we had a good time, we played cards, sang, 
chatted every day. I got infected with Covid but '''I didn't feel anything. We had a great 
time. '' 
 A friend of mine died of Covid. The last time we saw her we were playing cards, the rest 
of friends did not catch it, but she did and she died. '''That of taking the pandemic badly 
depends on each person ''. I have another friend who is having a hard time due to the 
pandemic, she is alone, with no family. I try to cheer her up and I tell her '''be happy, why 
are you going to complain about the pandemic, if it did not affect you? ''.  
Of course, I would like all this to end, so that my daughter can go back to work. I 
understand the sadness of the people but I can't do anything about that. Life has not 
changed for me, I am still the same. I did not get sick, and I feel positive ''.  
My son has a disability. The day he was born, I left him in the incubator and went to work 
at the bar. Later, the doctor told me what was happening and I decided, from the first 
moment, not to hide it, to act normal. The doctor told me '''the boy is not sick '' and it is 
true, he is strong like a bull '' just take him to the beach to enjoy. He received so much

United States,"''I am a 17 -year -old teenager who lives in a foster home for teenagers in a city 
in Spain . I have lived in this shelter for four years since I cannot live with my parents. In 
March 2020, when the pandemic started, I was 15 years old and I was in the third year of 
Compulsory Secondary Education. Although I am not a very good student (I do not 
usually get very good grades) I always end up passing all the subjects.  
 
The year of the pandemic, however, I ended up repeating the year because I became 
very unmotivated after we were unable to attend class. At first, they asked us to follow 
the classes online. At the house, we only had one computer that other children needed, 
so my social worker brought me a personal computer of hers that was a bit old an d did 
not work too well. However, I was able to follow the classes from the house, in my room. 
Although at first I tried to connect because educators forced me to attend clas ses in the 
morning, I soon lost motivation and did not connect to classes. The teachers also 
followed me up at the beginning, but then, as the weeks went by, they did not tell me 
anything. So, when the year ended, I did not pass most of the courses, and I finally had 
to repeat the school year.  
The following year, when we returned to class with a mask, it was like coming out of a 
cave. I did not know how to relate to my classmates, giving hugs and saying hello, for 
example, was a bit strange. In any case, the worst thing was that I was no longer with my 
classmates because they had passed the school year.  
In that year, it was very difficult for me to recover the rhythm of classes, the habit of 
studying, handing in assignments, etc... but the social workers enrolled me in an 
academy that helped me in some subjects (mathematics and science). With that help, 
and making an effort, I recovered the habit of studying and in the end I passed the school 
year. Now I am in the fourth year of Compulsory Secondary Education, and next year I 
want to attend the first year of high school. ''","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,good student (I do not usually get
Spain,"''My name is Sara, I was born in Morocco and I am 40 years old. I came to 
Spain more or less 10 years ago and I have always worked as a domestic and care worker 
with elderly women. Ten days before the lockdown was declared, in 2020, I lost my job 
 
 
 
and found myself without an accommodation, since the woman I was caring for died. 
Since the lockdown, I have not been able to find a job, but at least now I have a home, 
thanks to an association that works with homeless people.  
When I left Morocco for Ceuta [a Spanish enclave in southern borders] I did not speak a 
word of Spanish. I started working for an old lady who lived alone and little by little I 
learned the language. I lived together with her during 7 years and when she di ed, at the 
age of 90, I decided to leave Ceuta and travel to the Spanish peninsula. Her niece offered 
me stay in the house as long as I needed, and also to take some stuff, but I didn''t.  
First, I went to Barcelona, because an uncle lives there. In the city, I found another job 
with an old lady and I stayed there for more than a year. However, the lady got heart 
disease and her son decided to move her to an elderly care center. He told me t hat she 
needed more attention and I could not stay in the house. At that point, I went to my 
uncle''s house, but her wife did not want me there and since I had to leave, I decided to 
go to another city.  
I travelled with a friend, well, a woman I know, and I found a place to stay. The landlady 
had a neighbor who was looking for help and that''s how I found the job. I worked for the 
lady for one year, than she got sick and died at the hospital, ten days befo re the 
lockdown was declared, in February 2020.  
Back then, I had some money and I paid for a room to stay, but when I run out of money 
I left, because I felt ashamed and I could not stay there without paying. I contacted my 
friend asking for help and she allowed me to stay with her for some months, afte r that, 
she told me I needed to leave and earn a living.  
We went together to a centre for adults training, and there I met a guy, also a foreigner, 
who saw me crying and told me about a municipality service for social exclusion. I went 
there and told them my situation, but they could not help me, because I had n o 
residence certificate. I told my friend '''there''s nothing to do, I am going to sleep in the 
street''. But there is still nice people out there, and the next day a woman from civil 
protection called me and told me there was a place for me to stay, in a host el-pension, 
and she gave me a card for eating at the canteen. I took my pajama  and went to the 
hostel, where I stayed for about a week. The hostel was managed by  an association, I 
told them my story and they offered me to stay there. It was a former touristic building 
that was converted into a shelter for homeless people during the pandemic, with the 
help of the municipality. Now I live with other four woman, in a n apartment run by the 
association and I feel good.  
I attend Spanish classes to learn the language,  but I want to find a job, it does not matter 
the type of job. I can take care of an old lady or children, I don''t know how to read and 
write, but I know how to cook, do the cleaning and all other household chores. I am 
asking people and looking for a job,  but it has become even more difficult with the 
pandemic, people are afraid of having a person in their home, there is no trust. All I want 
is a contract and to arrange my papers.   
I don''t want to get the vaccine;  I am afraid of nothing and I prefer taking care of myself 
through natural remedies. It is true that because I am not vaccinated, I could not 
participate in some activities organised by the association after the covid breakout. '''","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",0,I am asking people and looking for
United States,"""I am a 47 -years old woman and an entrepreneur; I own a dance studio. I 
work as a dance teacher and dance artist. The pandemic has changed my life and the 
life of my family in many ways.  
My work as a dance artist was very much put on hold during the pandemic. We had a 
dance show that we had performed few times in the beginning of the year 2020 and 
were supposed to perform few times more but these were cancelled. Performances for 
the summer  were cancelled, too. During the pandemic, I''ve only got to do one 
performance about a year ago, in the autumn 2021. This was in a festival that I appreciate 
a lot. It was a dream come true but also a weird experience because, due to restrictions, 
there wa s not much audience and they were seated two meters from each other, wearing 
face masks.  
My work as a dance studio owner has continued throughout the pandemic but changed 
a lot. I could say that my job changed from a dance teacher to an office worker. It has 
been very laborious to re -organise our activities all the time, and to develop online 
booking systems and to provide online lessons.  
When the pandemic spread to Finland in March 2020, I did not understand the 
seriousness of all of it. I remember this one lesson, which turned out to be the last face -
to-face lesson during the spring 2020. I was kind of joking with my students whether we 
could meet the next week or not. The very next day we had to cancel all our lessons for 
the spring. It was not an official restriction but there was a strong social pressure to not 
to organise anything where the virus could spread. The guidelines and restri ctions were 
always announced for the next few weeks and, at first, we thought this would be over in 
few weeks. It was a good thing that we did not know how long this would last '' I think we 
would have closed down the company if we knew.  
Rather quickly, we began to organise online lessons, which was very laborious in the 
beginning. Also, we organised a virtual dance weekend together with other dance 
teachers and agreed that we would divide evenly all the money that was made with this 
virtu al event. All dance teachers were facing hard times in finding income and this way 
we could work together fairly. This was a really good experience.  
We were lucky to have some extra money on the company''s account so that we knew we 
would survive for three months even without any income. Also, we applied for funding 
from Business Finland and got 10 000 euros for re -organising our business during the 
spring 2020. We experienced our worst economic situation in 2021 during the complete 
shut -down, when we had already used most of our buffer money. At that point the 
government was providing some compensation for companies, but it was very difficult 
 
 
   155 
 
for dance studios to get this because you had to prove that your income had decreased 
significantly in comparison to a reference period, which happened to be February -
March. Dance studios don''t typically have much income that time of the year since most 
of the invoices for the spring are paid in January.  
For almost the whole time, we continued providing private lessons and dance space for 
couples who wanted to book a room to practice on their own. I noticed that I had to 
change my way of teaching because I normally teach by dancing with my students and 
touching them. That was an interesting experience, but it was scary, too. I remember that 
one day I felt I might have a sour throat and I was very worried that if I had Covid -19 I 
might have transmitted that to my students I provided private lessons for. When  we were 
able to continue providing group lessons during the summer 2020, I remember that this 
felt rather scary as well. Not all the clients took our Covid -19 instructions seriously. It took 
some time for me to relax and understand that I could not be responsible of everything 
that adult people decided to do. My personality matters here as well; I am very caring 
and concerned. I think this is typical for wom en in my age.  
During the autumn 2020, we could continue group lessons, although with smaller 
groups than before. This was possible until the restrictions began again in December 
2020. During the spring 2021 there was a complete lockdown of the society at large. 
The regi onal officials become familiar to us at that time. I called and asked whether 
private lessons could still be arranged, and this was granted since they were categorised 
as private events. However, many were not asking for private lessons. This was very hard  
time for us.  
Summer 2021 was still rather quiet but the autumn 2021 was better again. The 
vaccinations made the situation easier. Also, Covid  pass was introduced. However, its 
usage was not easy since this meant that some of our clients called and told that they 
could no longer participate in our lessons. It was not emotionally easy for me to hear. 
And then, at this moment, we are again restric ted for organising lessons since the pass 
has been put on hold. Luckily, this happened during the holidays and economic impact 
might not be that devastating for us.  
In some ways the pandemic has been a positive thing, too. For instance, this has been 
the first time in decades that I suddenly had free weekends and could have a dinner with 
my family on Saturday. We have also learned in my family that you really do not n eed 
much money to survive. We haven''t spent money on going to restaurants or ordering 
food, we haven''t bought anything expect some very necessary items, such as new shoes 
to be able to walk to work. I feel that some unnecessary things have been cleaned out  of 
my life and the pandemic has given me time to re -think how to better live up to my 
values.""","['Workplace', 'Public Space']",0,appreciate a lot. It was a dream
United States,"""I''m a 66 -year -old man, living together with my wife, children have already 
left from home. I retired half a year after the pandemic began. This meant that for the 
last half a year I had to do remote work. This was not voluntary for us; everybody was 
requi red to work from home. For the last month before my retirement, I would have been 
allowed to work from the office but there was no one there so I just continued working 
from home. They wanted to organise a farewell coffee for me, and I agreed to do that. 
However, a day before the event we were restricted from organising anything face -to-
face and the coffee was arranged online. That was interesting in a way but not so much 
fun.  
Overall, the pandemic has made me more passive. It''s hard to find things to do outside 
home. I''ve been reading a lot, and of course it''s possible to ski or cycle if the weather is 
nice. However, normally I would do lots of things that haven''t been possible  now. For 
instance, I would go to concerts a lot, and I would visit museums more often. All that 
hasn''t either been possible or has been more complicated. Currently, even the movie 
theatres are closed once again. Some of the museums are open and there is t his one 
exhibition that I''d like to see, but I''m not sure if I will go. And the shops are open, but I 
don''t feel like going for shopping.  
It hasn''t been very easy to meet my friends either. There have been different kinds of 
guidelines and restrictions, and then one has to consider all the time if it is possible to 
meet or not. The vaccinations helped the situation somewhat. Most of my friends have 
now taken their third vaccinations. I''ve been going out for a lunch every now and then. 
If there was no pandemic and remote working, I would probably have been going out 
for a lunch with m y ex-colleagues a lot more. I''ve also observed that several lunch places 
that I used to go went to bankrupt during the pandemic.  
I worked as a voluntary worker for the Redd Cross, guiding people who came to take 
vaccinations. In the beginning, people had to wait for a while before they were called in 
and we told them where they could wait. Also, after you''ve been given the vaccinati on, 
you have to wait for 15 minutes. We guided people to the waiting area and observed 
them to see if somebody would get an anaphylactic reaction. Currently they are 
organising new vaccinations again and I''m waiting to hear if voluntary workers are 
needed this time or not.  
My parents are rather old already and I''ve been somewhat worried about how they are 
doing. However, they have not fallen ill, and now they have their third vaccinations, too. 
They live in another city and my mother lives in the elderly home. I visit them e very now 
and then. The pandemic didn''t change this so much because my mother is able to leave 
the elderly home and we can then spend time at my fathers'' home.  
I think the political decision making regarding the restrictions and other measures 
during the pandemic has been rather messy. We''ve got a very complex system of who 
 
 
   157 
 
has the power to decide on what. I can understand that it has been difficult for many 
people to follow this, and this is reflected in debates in the media and elsewhere. I think 
wearing a face mask is unpleasant for a longer time. Also, seeing people not wearing 
the mask in the shops is annoying though. For instance, I''ve noticed that many of the 
construction workers do not wear face masks in the grocery.  
I have some things planned in the future that I''m very much looking forward to. We are 
planning to travel to Lapland and Åland, and I''m planning to participate in a music 
festival. I don''t believe that they will announce a complete lockdown anymore and I''m  
rather hopeful that I can do these things.""",['Domestic'],1,complete lockdown anymore and I''m rather hopeful
United States,"""I''m a 70 -year -old woman, I live together with my husband. Also, my 
daughter''s family lives rather near to us and we see each other often.  
The pandemic has narrowed down things that I have been able to do. I''m retired, which 
means that my life is rather home -centred anyway, but the pandemic has made it even 
more so. For instance, I''m active in some NGOs related to my profession but most of th e 
events have been cancelled or organised online.  
I think it''s rather sad that theatres, concerts, movie theatres and different kinds of public 
events have been cancelled and restricted for long periods of time. Normally, I would 
have enjoyed participating in them much more. For instance, although I''m ret ired, I''m 
involved in many groups and organisations related to my profession. We''ve got 
interesting programme and many speakers in these meetings in the past.  
I''ve met friends and relatives every now and them. Sometimes it has been possible and 
sometimes not. We''ve met in small groups, been cautious, and during the summertime 
 
we''ve met outside. One graduation party was organised in the autumn although 
graduation happened in June. My own 70th birthday passed without much celebration. 
Many people sent congratulations and said it would be great to do something together 
when it is possible again.  
In the beginning of the pandemic, it was all very scary. There were no face masks in 
Finland, and no vaccinations, of course. We made a deal with two of our neighbours that 
if we fall ill, they will take care of our practicalities and the other way round. However, 
later we got used to live with the pandemic. It hasn''t felt that scary anymore. My close 
ones have not fallen ill with Covid -19. However, we still haven''t, for instance, travelled 
abroad during the whole time. Normally, I enjoy visiting cities in Europe.  
I''m a person who wants to plan and organise things well ahead. My husband sometimes 
says that I shouldn''t organise so much and then be disappointed when things do not 
happen. However, I think it''s important to do plans so that time doesn''t just pass. 
Somet imes patience has paid off, too. For instance, it was possible to visit this exhibition 
of a famous Russian artist, when I just waited for the right time to book the tickets. Also, 
theatres have organised shows for smaller audiences.  
I think that patience, life experiences, sense of security, common sense, and the fact that 
I live together with my husband has helped me during the pandemic. We have our daily 
routines, waking up, making coffee, going out for a walk, friends calling to us , and our 
daughter living nearby. She''s expecting a baby, too, and this is very exciting for me as 
well. All this has helped me to stay positive during the pandemic.""","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",1,"70 -year -old woman, I live"

extra workers were needed in kindergartens. I''m an educated professional but in a low -

Overall, I think the pandemic has changed the society to a direction that I don''t like. 
Society has become even more individualistic and there is less solidarity. Inequalities 
 
 
     
 
have increased, and life has become more expensive. Many Covid -19 related 
recommendations and restrictions cost. For instance, buying face masks costs, ordering 
food home costs more than buying it from the grocery, and it is more difficult for many 
to get food aid. In the beginning of the pandemic, there was help available for g etting 
groceries, and the city provided home deliveries that costed three euros. After that, 
those services have not been available. Also, many of the free cultural events and 
meetin gs have been cancelled.  
At the same time, many people like me have lost their sources of additional income. I 
used to do some extra work in kindergartens, but this ended when the pandemic began. 
They are more hesitant to employ extra people, and particularly people who are older 
than 70 years.  
I feel that media portrays mainly very middle -class or upper -class experience of the 
pandemic. For instance, at some point it was discussed a lot whether one should or 
should not visit their summer cottage. Also, it has been said that people have a lot of 
extra money because they haven''t been able to travel abroad. However, money 
problems that many are facing due to pandemic are not discussed. This is rather 
alienating. I am currently watching the national news once a day and reading the 
newspaper in the mo rning. In social media, I only spend time in friendly groups. There, 
I have even met some new people and developed new hobbies. I''ve been reading more 
and taking care of potted plants.  
The information about different restrictions has been messy and confusing. In the 
beginning of the pandemic, it felt like the government worked together to get us 
through this but, later, they have been arguing a lot and the message that comes out has 
been  very confusing at times. For instance, the guidelines regarding the usage of face 
masks changed completely. I understand that our knowledge on Covid -19 has increased 
gradually but seeing how politicians argue about different measures is depressing. 
Curren tly, we get a lot of contradictory information from different officials. This doesn''t 
motivate to follow restrictions. Also, opening the society even though 80 % of people 
had not taken vaccinations, which was supposed to be reached before opening society,  
did not probably encourage not vaccinated people to take the vaccination.  
In the beginning of the pandemic, people over 70 -years of age were discussed as 
vulnerable people who need protection. That was problematic. That talk easily impacts 
one''s feeling for self -worth. Also, sometimes I could sense in the grocery that there was 
aggression towards me due to my age. I think some people were annoyed that they had 
to limit their lives in order to protect us. This doesn''t happen anymore, probably because 
age groups are not discussed so much. When people over 70 -years of age were 
recom mended to stay in quarantine in the beginning of the pandemic, I did that, 
although I did go out for walks. My daughters helped me in that phase. After the 
beginning, I have been careful, but I have met my children and their families, and I have 
met my fri ends. I have a group of friends and we meet each other in our homes.  
I''m worried about children. Children in general and my own grandchildren, too. If there 
are no activities for children, some of them will misbehave in addition to feeling bad. 
This pandemic has been very hard for many families. I''ve helped my daughters, fo r 
instance, by cooking for them when they had to simultaneously work remotely and take 
care of their children who were studying remotely from home. One of my grandchildren 
 is currently in his last year of primary school and his grades have gone down during the 
pandemic. We have a goal to get the grades up again because the grades are important 
for getting into the general upper secondary school in the capital area. Also, I have 
noticed that the pandemic has ruined some of the community spirit that we have in thi s 
house. This house is owned by the city and we pay rent for the city. I''ve been active in 
representing our voice for the city. I realised that in the last meeting, pe ople were 
organised in separate groups, such as based on ethnicity, which hasn''t happened for a 
long time. Some of them were angry that common spaces had been closed due to the 
pandemic and it was not clear to everyone that this was an order from the city.  
I have lost my ability to sleep properly during the pandemic. I worry so much how some 
of my close ones are coping that thoughts go around in my head and I cannot get sleep. 
I have accepted this. I fall asleep in the early morning and sleep then for as lon g as I can. 
It is very difficult to get an appointment in the community health centre. I have tried few 
times due to different problems and it takes a long time to get the appointment.  
The pandemic has also made me think how many years of active life I will still have ahead 
of me. I think this is probably very common experience for us older people in risk groups. 
We count how many years of active life we might have and then we count how many 
years we are losing for the pandemic. I think it''s important to be active, and to do things 
that I find meaningful to do. I want to help out, spend time with my children, 
grandchildren and close friends, and to be active in the local community. Also, I like to 
do things, such as visit art museum s. I''m a people person, I want to be around people, 
even if I would just take public transportation on my own and visit a museum.""","['Education', 'Domestic']",1,73 -year -old woman. I live
United States,"""I''m a 52 -year -old, non -binary gender person. Overall, the pandemic hasn''t 
affected me that much. In the beginning of the pandemic, when there was a complete 
lock-down, I didn''t go anywhere and realised that I didn''t get enough exercise. Normally, 
I go out  to eat in restaurants and to meet my friends. When the restaurants were closed, 
there was no reason to go anywhere. I gained some weight, and it has been very difficult 
to get back to the original weight.  
Last autumn, however, I started going to the gym, for the first time in my life. I was 
surprisingly persistent in going there '' until the gyms were closed a while ago. Since I 
have many problems in my life (that are not related to pandemic), I''m not sure i f I have 
 
 
     
 
the energy to start going anymore when it''s possible. I will try of course.  
The good thing that I observed in the beginning of the pandemic was that people 
stopped going to bars to drink, and all problems related to that disappeared. Later, 
people started to organise parties in their homes but in the beginning it was very quiet, 
in a good way, too. However, when I sometimes visited the centre of the city, I could see 
that there was no one else there but the drug abusers and people, who have big 
problems in their lives. I think they have always been there but when there was no one 
else, they became more visible. That was sad to see. I''m sensitive to these issues due to 
some of my life experiences.  
 
When the pandemic began, I was unemployed and received basic social assistance. 
They raised the social assistance with 80 euros for the first year, so that people were able 
to buy face masks, hand sanitizers, and so on. That was very nice. After the first year, this 
stopped. I think that''s OK because face masks are now very cheap, and I''m rarely using 
hand sanitizers anymore.  I regularly get food from two projects, a waste food project 
organised nearby where I used to live, and a food charity project, where  I also work as a 
volunteer. These two projects continued throughout the pandemic. The waste food 
project is rather self -organised by the shopkeeper and us who receive the food. In the 
beginning of the pandemic, we were trying to keep two meters distances while 
distributing the food, but it took so much time to share the food that way that we decided 
not to keep distances. We agreed to use face masks and otherwise act as always, as we 
meet outside anyway. Some of the people in the group became rather close friends, I 
think partly because of the pandemic. I''m sad I had to move away from the area as the 
landlord suddenly increased my rent so much. In a charity food project, we began to 
pack food to bags that are ready to simply be picked up. I''ve been helping in packing 
them. I suppose that practice will continue, and I will continue volunteering there.  
 
I''ve had friends to meet throughout the pandemic. Also, I''ve been able to visit my 
relatives in Sweden a few times. Currently, the restrictions are rather similar in both 
countries but, during the first year, Sweden and Finland had very different strategie s to 
deal with the pandemic. For instance, they do not use face masks in Sweden. It''s been 
confusing at times, but I''ve mostly done as people around me do. Both strategies have 
their strengths, I suppose. My mother lives in a Finnish senior house in Sweden , and 
there many of them follow Finnish news. In there, they have required face masks.  
I haven''t been afraid of falling ill. Also, I''ve got already three vaccinations. I took the first 
vaccinations quickly because I got a special written invitation due to belonging in a risk 
group, and because I thought I would need them to enter Sweden. I w as never checked 
though. Currently, I''ve also got my third vaccination.  
I think the funding for companies wasn''t organised very well, although lots of funding 
was given out by the government. In my opinion, they should have provided some 
funding for small companies to make bankrupts gracefully, so that entrepreneurs would 
not end up living with money problems for the rest of their lives. Instead, funding was 
mostly provided for new investments only.  
 
At some point, I realised that I was watching a lot of gigs and big concerts from YouTube. 
These events seem to have happened in another life. I''m wondering if stars like Madonna 
will ever do world tours anymore. Also, now that movie theatres are closed, I would very 
much like to go to movies. Not that I normally go that often, and tickets will probably be 
very expensive when they open again.""","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",1,"drug abusers and people, who have"
United States,"""I''m an artist, a 46 -year -old man. I live together with my husband and our cats.  
During the pandemic, our home has begun to feel like a prison to me. Home has always 
been an important place for me, a safe place that protects me from the world outside. 
I''m a collector and I have carefully decorated our home so that it''s a special place that 
reflects my personality, too. However, during the pandemic my relation to our home 
chang ed. I don''t enjoy it anymore. I want to be anywhere else but home. I''ve become an 
innocent prisoner.  
I have an ADD diagnosis, meaning that my mind is very active and it''s sometimes difficult 
for me to get my mind to stop. When I was forced to stay at home all the time, this activity 
turned into a negative force. Nothing at home could inspire me anymore, a nd everything 
I did and thought at home blurred in my head. My brain reacted to this by paralysing 
completely. There were times when all I could do was to lay in bed my brain paralysed. 
Also, time lost its meaning. Everything was blurred timewise, too, and  that did not help 
my brain either. Summer provided a short relief, because then it was possible to go 
outside without planning it, but that lasted only five weeks last summer. Since then, I''ve 
been a prisoner again. Or eternally a 17 -year -old, who cannot go anywhere and only 
waits that life one day begins.  
 
I''ve been working from home all the time. However, my art exhibition in London was 
cancelled because of the pandemic. I organized it in Finland but there were only a few 
visitors. It was as if there was no exhibition. Also, I organized one more commerciall y 
oriented exhibition in Finland, and there were very few visitors, too, and I only made one 
sale. I''ve applied for pandemic related funding for artists and got it. It''s easy for me to 
write plans in the applications as I plan something all the time anyway . However, I don''t 
think that it was fair to make us to write plans and compete for funding. Every 
professional artist should have simply received funding. Instead, money was provided 
for many big companies that did not even need it.  
I feel like I''m waiting for something all the time. I''m waiting for this pandemic to end, and 
not sure when I could believe that it really has ended. We are currently going for a short 
vacation abroad and in addition to really wanting to go I feel somehow anxious. I think it 
is because we all have been under an additional stress for such a long tim e, it''s difficult 
to stop stressing. It''s sometimes difficult to even tell what is my personality, and what is 
caused by the pandemic, but I don''t think I would h ave been anxious in this situation 
before the pandemic.  
 
I''ve been very disappointed to see how our government handled the pandemic. It''s been 
a very political process in which fierce illogical debates have been done in publicity. I 
can understand these debates with the opposition, but not with the officials and  
politicians in the same government. It''s been very sad to see, and it diminishes my trust 
to this government and Finnish government in general. There should have been more 
epidemiologists leading the situation. Some of the mistakes include the fact that F inland 
was not able to control its borders on crucial moments. Thousands of people arrive with 
ferries, for instance from Estonia, and they are not even forced to use face masks. Also, 
after the football match in the St. Petersburg in 2021, the new wave hi t Finland sooner 
than expected when the Finns returned from the game without testing and quarantines. 
It would have been better to restrict more on the borders and less inside the country.  
One of the problems is that the government has provided many recommendations and 
'''strong recommendations'' instead of clearly restricting people. There''s always this one 
third of people who don''t follow recommendations. This has divided people and made 
us h ate each other. I think this is also one reason why we have so many people that 
oppose vaccinations. It''s become an issue that one can decide oneself. And there is a lot 
of propaganda out there, it''s like a religion. I once years ago used myself as a bad 
example to show through my art what happens when you believe in conspiracy theories 
regarding a virus, in that case HIV. I''ve learned from that, but most people have not 
learned that, of course. They still believe the shit that goes around.  
I hope that my feelings towards our home will be normalised at some point. I don''t know 
how long that will take and what I need to do to accomplish that. Moving abroad for a 
while might help.""","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",1,shit that goes around. I hope
Finland,"""I''m a 27 -year -old man, I''m Dutch and I moved to Finland first time in 2019 
and then again in 2020, to do my PhD here.  
The pandemic has affected me in many ways, although I''ve also been very privileged 
and not faced as hard time some others. When the pandemic began in 2020, I was in the 
Netherlands finishing my master''s thesis. I had just returned from abroad, and I would 
have wanted to meet my family and friends often, but this was mostly not possible 
because of the pandemic. Also, I was gathering data for my thesis in a hospital 
environment. At that point, there was a shortage of face masks and other hygiene 
products, and  I was not allowed to come to the hospital anymore. This of course affected 
my data collection.  
Later in 2020, I moved to Finland and began my PhD studies. It''s been a weird time to 
begin working in a new organisation. We are allowed to work from the office, and I have 
done it, but there are very few people around there. I know most of my colleagues only 
through Teams meetings. I think I''ve missed out a lot of informal talk, which could lead 
to very important conversations and connections in the field of research work. I haven''t 
participated in any f2f conferences either. Also, as a PhD student you do n''t have a boss 
telling you what you should do; it''s your PhD. This freedom combined with not seeing 
other people working around you makes the job challenging. I have a good self -
discipline, but still I do work better and am distracted less if I can see ot her people 
working around me as well.  
During this year and a half, I have accomplished almost all my course work. All the 
courses have been organised online. I would have preferred f2f teaching because that 
is more engaging. However, I have managed through making study and work schedules 
to my self and sticking into them. I''ve also had a nice office, and a nice home, and I''ve 
already had an experience of enjoying social studying life when I did by bachelor''s and 
master''s programmes. For these reasons, the situation has been alright for me.  
The pandemic has made travelling and moving to another country a lot more 
complicated. When I moved to Finland, they had just introduced a new system which 
had to be used to book a time for a meeting in the Finnish immigration service. However, 
all the tim es were booked. I had to check every week if there were cancellations to finally 
be able to book a meeting with them in time.  
Travelling has been restricted and made very complicated. I travelled to the Netherlands 
to see my family and friends in the summer 2021, when I had been here for over a year 
already. At that point, I had only got one vaccination as the vaccinations were g iven 
 
 
   167 
 
based on one''s age. This meant that I had to get tested for Covid -19 all the time to be 
able to do anything in the Netherlands. I visited the Netherlands again during the 
Christmas break and that was much easier as I already was fully vaccinated at that point.  
I like sports. I do a lot of strength training, and in summertime I practice football. Going 
to the gym is an important part of my life. It was thus rather annoying when the gyms 
were closed in Finland for a long time. As the weather is very cold in Finlan d, it is not 
easy to do the kinds of sports that I like outside. Also, it was frustrating to see that bars 
were simultaneously open.  
Overall, we haven''t had very severe restrictions in Finland. I think Finns are in general 
rather obedient and trust their government. That''s why complete lockdowns and curfews 
have not been necessary here. In the Netherlands, people have resisted restricti ons 
much more, and that''s why stronger restrictions have been necessary. Also, if I look at 
the news of the Finnish parliament, they always wear face masks and show good 
example to people. It''s convincing in comparison to some Dutch politicians, who tell 
people to use masks, but do not use them themselves.""",['Workplace'],1,sports. I do a lot of strength
United States,"""I am a doctoral student;  I come from North Africa and now live in France. I 
gave birth to my second child during the first lockdown.  
 I started my thesis at the end of 2017,  and I need to travel for my fieldwork. I've always 
done that while pregnant, I've always enjoyed it. During my first pregnancy, I was able 
to do this very well. The first 6 months, babies sleep a lot, I took the opportunity to read, 
write... In August 201 9, I became pregnant again, I said to myself, I'm going to take 
advantage of it to do the second part of the fieldwork since my older daughter was going 
to nursery.  
My husband had a small business offering services for company employees: leisure 
travel activities. The lockdown blocked everything, so on the bank account, zero. We 
were afraid for my husband, I told him to stay at home. The priority became survival, so 
everything that concerned me, concerned my thesis '' that I consider real work - became 
secondary. I'm not a stay -at-home person at all, it was really hard for me, really, really 
hard, I think that was the hardest part, having to focus on domestic life. I wa s very tired, 
my daughter was small, she was getting to the age where she was starting to move 
around a lot. So I was very, very bad.  
And I don't have any family here, all my family is abroad, so I have no help, I have no 
support. My husband's mother lives in the same city, so we decided to go and stay with 
her. At least I wasn't going to worry about all the cooking, cleaning, because I was at the 
end of the pregnancy. But the flat was very small, there were five of us, plus the little one, 
plus my big belly, so it was a lot! I'm an only child, I'm not used to being with many 
people. So it was mentally very heavy for me, very frustrating.   
I gave birth on the 17th of April, one month after the lockdown started. My husband was 
not allowed to stay with us except during the delivery. We arrived at the hospital at night, 
he had to stay outside in the car park until the midwives said it was time for me to go into 
the delivery room. That's when he came in, I gave birth, everything went well, he stayed 
with me for an hour or two and then he left and couldn't come back. So there I was with 
my baby, my suitcase that I had to carry up to the room by my self. It was really tough. 
The nurses couldn't look after my baby when I was showering... On the other hand, I was 
very happy to have some solitude, it was quite relaxing. I just wanted to have my husband 
with me... Thank God it was my second baby. I would n't have liked to experience that 
with the first one.  
Then there was the transnational family aspect. When the covid started, we were terribly 
afraid for our families. They live in countries that are economically unequal and 
structurally unequal. The hospitals are in a very bad state, there are no resources, so 
people die outside on the steps. So, I imagined my father or my uncles or my 
grandmothers... We were really worried about this. And, in France, it's becoming a bit 
 
 
   170 
 
complicated to feel good. There is always the suspicion of not being a good citizen, the 
good immigrant... I like living in this city because it's a good compromise between who 
I was and who I am. It's a city that totally corresponds to me. But I don't want my children 
to stay here.  
My husband is a man who is totally committed to our life, he's really 100% for equality. 
But he had to go to work. I had a very, very bad time, I couldn't take it anymore, it was 
hard. I couldn't do any fieldwork until September. For me, it's mainly the sc hools. I think 
that the majority of mothers will say that. Because that's where equality is really at stake. 
When you get a call from the school, from the nursery, the couple look at each other and 
in a non -verbal communication, they are gauging who is goi ng to sacrifice themselves. 
And if the other person doesn't sacrifice, there's resentment.  
In September, I took my suitcase and left. I said, you're doing fine, we have childcare, 
the children are fine, they're healthy, I've finished my mission! So I went back onto the 
field, I attended conferences, I was very happy. My thesis work is really my comfort zone, 
my power zone, it makes me feel good, I feel alive. Many people suffer because of their 
work, I chose to do it, I love it. The lockdown was hard but it allowed me to write.  
I have no choice, I'm in a rather delicate situation. I arrived in France in 2015, I'm a 
foreigner, I queue at 5am at the prefecture to get my papers. There is a lot of uncertainty 
in the world of research. As I made a rather risky choice, compared to the rather 
comfortable career I was in, I don't want to fail. That's what keeps me going. I absolutely 
have to succeed. The pandemic has changed me actually, it has changed us totally. It's 
strengthened me and my husband, it's brought us closer together, becau se ... I know a 
lot of couples that haven't survived. (...). We were lucky, we didn't lose anyone close to 
us, that's good. We didn't get the covid, that's exceptional.""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",3,it has changed us totally. It's strengthened
United States,"""I am 49, I am married and I have two daughters, 12 and 17. I a social worker 
in a CSO and I live in France.  
What impacted me was not so much the announcement of the disease - we knew we had 
to protect ourselves - but I wanted to reassure my family. I have the image of a great 
emptiness because we were no longer in contact with the people we were 
accompanying. Be cause we didn''t have access to our offices, we no longer had the 
telephone numbers of people we knew were in difficulty. We should have reassured 
them, guided them for food, for the lack of resources.  
In our CSO, we follow people on minimum benefits. We also put people looking for work 
in touch with CSOs and companies who might employ them. On the social side and the 
work side, it was obvious that a permanent presence was needed. We closed strictly for 
15 days and then we set up a telephone watch. There were between 40 and 50 messages 
a day, it was unimaginable! Four or five colleagues stayed in the office, either obliged or 
a voluntarily. So our head of department would contact us and for situations whe re the 
family's history was needed, we went there.  
A network was set with various structures and CSOs that were created to collect and 
distribute food. The family allowances files were no longer processed, there were breaks 
in the process. It was a difficult time for families, everything was on hold. Final ly the 
minimum benefits were maintained, and even if everything was not clear, the 
department and the family allowance fund found a tacit agreement. Then there was the 
psychological aspect, with the children at home who were no longer getting school 
meals,  which meant significant additional costs. And the question of children in small, 
run-down flats. Families with young children suffering from asthma. Normally, it is 
already extremely time -consuming to have mold samples taken and to file applications 
for rehousing. The management of the school work too...  
Hotels were requisitioned, a holiday centre was also opened, but it closed afterwards. 
 
 
      
 
People occupied houses left vacant by owners who had left for the countryside... Being 
locked up for two months must have been extremely difficult. Unstable husbands... I 
think there was a lot of violence too. For months after the lockdown, we treated the most 
fragile, but communication was still poor! I am also thinking of extended families  with 
relatives in other countries who were affected by the disease. The deaths of people who 
were close but geographically distant, for whom it was not possible to mour n properly. 
Referral to professional psychologists or psychiatrists was complicated, they did not 
always receive people. We had people who were no longer heard from... We had people 
who died, I think of a man who died of isolation. Suicide? Or something th at physically 
broke down? He was very active, walking around the city all day. He died from staying at 
home without moving.  
Knowing that everything was closed during the lockdown, maybe some people didn't 
dare get un touch with us. We should have given them better information so that they 
could contact us. I didn't have their phone numbers, I didn't have a way to check my 
email . It was my colleague, my head of department who looked at them for me and 
called me when it was really important. We were really cut off. Then, when we reopened, 
it was only partly satisfactory: we couldn't receive everyone, we had to avoid having too 
man y people on the premises. We kept the phone lines and when there was a need, we 
received people. Each referent follows 140 to 150 people! This figure is imposed by the 
department. Ideally, and even more so in confinement, it should be reduced to 70 
people.  This is regularly requested but...  
In the department offices, there was only one social worker, almost always the same one, 
and the director. The others were teleworking but they didn't have what it took to 
telework. The department's social workers have to be in contact with the minimum 
benefit reception centers for questions of health, housing etc.... We have the possibility 
of asking for financial aid for children from the department, but the service was closed.  
I remember a man who permanently was out of work before the lockdown, but who 
worked as a volunteer distributing food aid. He was so proud, he said: '''I worked during 
the confinement ''. He revealed himself, we needed him. Little positive things like that 
came out, it was very amazing. But now he's back like he was before.  
I really appreciated being able to slow down, to be together at the beginning, with my 
husband and daughters, in a decent house with enough to buy food. The CSO made 
sure to pay our salary in full. But among the people we follow, no one has said they were 
happy, it was not possible for them, because of their financial and housing problems.""","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,"49, I am married and I have"
United States,"""I am a 25 -years -old trans man and I live in France. In 2018, I created an 
association to defend the rights of trans people for administrative, social, legal and 
support accompaniment to people and their families. We have a public of all ages, very 
heterog eneous: from the very precarious and marginalized to people with no socio -
economic problems and people from very privileged backgrounds. We provide training, 
information and awareness -raising activities for the general public, professionals and 
other organizations on trans identity, to combat exclusion. We have group or individual 
meetings, social services, discussion groups that offer a safe environment for non -binary 
trans people to share their experiences and help each other. We receive famili es and 
relatives who can talk about their fears and difficulties. We do family mediation.  
Individually, they talk about their difficulties, get information about gender affirmation, 
changing their first name, social housing, links with the medical sector, psychologists, 
etc.  We have a health centre, and cultural activities (theatre, dance, cin ema, debates) 
and care activities (art therapy). We work with volunteers: people affected by 
transphobia (peer helpers) and volunteers who are not affected but are qualified (health, 
legal, social, etc.).  
When the pandemic was announced, I refused to give up or put the activity on hold, it 
would generate great distress and demand would increase. Except during the first 
lockdown, the activity remained unchanged. We were even able to organise an 
international  day against transphobia, with an outdoor dance performance because the 
theatres were reopening only for professionals. These were ambitious projects and we 
succeeded! I made certificates to say that we were meeting to support the most 
precarious people, s o that people could move around and we did everything in person. 
It's more dangerous not to meet because you see an increase in depression, suicide and 
transphobic violence.  
That gave us energy to deal with untenable situations, on a daily basis: confinement, with 
no possible strategies to avoid meeting non -accepting, rejecting or violent parents or 
partners. We lost contact with people who were forced to stay in a transphobic  
environment so as not to be alone. Several people had to change accommodation 
frequently to ensure a safe space. Several reported family members attempting on their 
lives! It says something about what was imposed on people.  
Housing is a big issue. We have always had people who live on the streets and there are 
some  people who are not even aware of their rights. For people on the street who were 
already living in the alternative community system, it hasn't changed much. A lot  of 
people are in that situation! The pandemic has also had an impact on people who are 
integrated and who depend on all sorts of things that stopped: loss of income, loss of

social ties, having to live with their parents, their spouse. They said: '''We're going to end 
up fighting'', or '''My family is abusing me '', or they heard '''You're not my son anymore, 
I'm going to kill you!''. We need real, specifically designed accommodation.  
Last year we had a drastic drop in attendance, and also a drop in voluntary work, as in 
all CSOs. The management of the CSO has been difficult, everything has become more 
complex, people are afraid or discouraged, and it is difficult to find the necessary 
resources. Because of advocacy and growing media presence, the institutions have 
become quite receptive (rectorate, city, the regional heath agency, department, the 
ministry of health...)  
The department supported us a lot during this period. But with Social Security, things 
got tougher, with totally unreasonable demands: requests for certificates from 
endocrinologists, psychiatrists, additional administrative procedures compared to cis -
gend er people. During the pandemic, did they tighten up access for budgetary reasons? 
It is unacceptable to consider that gender affirming care is not essential!  
We kept going as much as possible online. The Messenger group became a 
battleground, everybody was on edge. And then, while many younger people were able 
to go onto Discord vocal, the over -35-year -olds ...  
In these situations, we need clear instructions from the State, so that we have full 
legitimacy to pursue our activities. For a trans person who comes out, nothing else 
matters. They will drop everything to do their thing, and if they have to take risks to  do 
it, they will. The person needs access to the care they want, whether it's hormonal, 
surgical, whatever. And now everything has been cancelled: appointments, operating 
theatres. It really made things worse. We gave out hormones for free. They were the 
same hormones that they would have got at a pharmacy with a prescription. What 
changed was the lack of medical surveillance. And pharmacies, for long -term 
treatments, renewed people''s prescriptions, to avoid them going to their doctor and 
cluttering up the  waiting room. That was a good move on their part. There should be no 
cessation of activity for us, and no cessation of care, no discontinuity, as well as provision 
of accommodation for people in situations of intra -family violence. ""","['Healthcare', 'Public Space']",1,relatives who can talk about their fears
United States,"""I am Brazilian dancer and costume maker. I am 49 and I have two daughters 
in their twenties who are students. I left my husband who was violent and sought refuge 
in France about 10 years ago. I have polyarthromyalgia.  
At first, I was afraid of the situation in general. My daughters came down to spend the 
lockdown with me. We didn't know what could happen the next day, it was really difficult, 
and I didn't have a job. The girls were scared and worried about catching it, especially 
for me because I have respiratory problems, health problems, so without the vaccine, it 
was fatal for me to get it. We were really confined at home, the three of us, without being 
able to go out. At first it was very complicated, I had no more o rders for costumes, they 
were all completely cancelled. I was also afraid because my older daughter is studying 
to be a nurse. I saw doctors and nurses dropping like flies, dead because of covid. She 
was summoned, she was forced to go and work with the pat ients, in the hospital, she 
saw everything. She took the vaccinations of course, I  had to also, because of my 
disease.  
In Brazil, we lived well: no money problems, no residence permit, no need to ask for 
help, I was a homeowner, I made a good living. When I arrived here I thought I could fin 
the same job I had in Brazil, specialised educator. My application for the recogni tion of 
my diploma was rejected every time. I had to work to feed my daughters, to support 
them. So I became a capoeira and dance teacher, I had no choice and as I have a dance 
diploma... I gave classes from Monday to Friday, Saturday and Sunday I did show s. I was 
always on the run, I never stopped. That's why the confinement...  
With my illness I couldn't work like before. I have polyarthromyalgia, it's degenerative, I 
can't do anything about it, nor can the doctors. With the psychiatrist, we had 
teleconsultations. It was a bit complicated, but he was always there, by phone, he wa s 
great. The other treatments could wait. I stopped doing the shows and I compensated 
 
 
     
 
by sewing costumes. I had quite a few orders for clothes for  shows. With the covid, this 
was no longer possible: the galas, the shows, everything was cancelled.  
During the confinement it was impossible for me to be well. I took the medication and 
everything like I was supposed to, but during the lockdown it was impossible for me to 
be well. I had bad thoughts, bad ideas, you could say that.  
During the lockdown, the Family Allowance Fund suddenly stopped paying my benefits. 
I spent two months in the doldrums, I was really desperate. I had to prove that I and my 
daughters had been here for five years, that I had a residence permit to validate m y 
rights. I provided all the papers that prove this, that I have paid taxes, that I am legal in 
the country. But I needed a certificate from the prefecture and it was closed. All my 
orders had stopped, my savings were gone. I had rent to pay. I had to ask a social worker 
for help. She gave me food vouchers to get by with my girls. That's all we had, and what's 
more, not all supermarkets take the vouchers!  
What saved me was a man who collected the masks that I made. He helped me a lot at 
that time. I am grateful. He even brought me milk, bread, vegetables because he knew I 
had nothing left. He paid me for the masks because he knew that I was not well off 
financially. It affected the girls a lot too! He spoke with a lady he knew, he told her about 
my problems. I didn't know her at all. I went to the appointment she gave me with the 
certificate and all that. She gave me lots of food because I had nothing left a t home. It 
was a miracle! It was good timing, the moment, the day, the time, everything! Another 
Brazilian called me, who had made contact with someone else who told her about my 
difficulties, the unpaid rent, no money, no work and that I was afraid of end ing up on the 
street. She had gone shopping for me too and she said, '''This is for you ''.  
I saw people who didn't care about skin colour, nationality. They just wanted to help a 
mother stuck with her children. I will never forget that. Nobody accepted me as an 
educator because I was a foreigner. With the racism in Brazil, we are used to fightin g, 
me and my daughters. I thought it would be completely different here: no racism, no 
prejudice... The covid, it's as if we foreigners had brought it here. People in the social 
sector told us: '''If you left your country and you're here, it means you're sic k... You have 
brought the variant from Brazil '''. I imagine that for Asians, it was even worse. Finally I 
managed to get an answer from the prefecture, after the lockdown in May 2020. 
Fortunately, the estate agency understood that my rights were not respected and did 
not kick me out!  
The lockdown is an excuse. For the institutions, we are foreigners, illegal. They create 
problems and use covid to justify that. They took advantage of covid to deny us our 
rights. We are living beings too. We know that there is covid, everyone goes throug h the 
same thing but that doesn't mean that we don't have rights or that we have fewer rights 
than others. I kept the same social worker, before, during and after covid.  Now I need 
the Disability Agency to accept my file so that I can work with a disabled  status. Even 
now, we are still fighting against the system. It's not complicated to understand how it 
works but it's very complicated to get aid.""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,"status. Even now, we are still fighting"
United States,"""I am 53, I have a son who lives with his mother. I live with my partner and, in 
the beginning of the pandemic, I worked in a CSO as a specialized educator with 
prostitutes. I am French, of African origin.  
 
 
     
 
When I think back, I think of the agonizing mess it was for everyone. Nothing was clear. 
The contradictions of the experts, the doctors, the misinformation, it added fear to the 
disease. The first people to return from China were quarantined... The ministers and civil 
servants said: '''Move along, there's nothing to see, we've got it under control ''. They 
should have swallowed their pride. Fatigue was beginning to accumulate for the hospital 
workers. I had to continue working outdoors, I was beginning to be af raid. I painted a lot 
during that period and wrote a lot in the evenings. Since I worked with people who had 
greater needs than I did, that helped me put things into perspective. With one of the 
girls I was following, I found myself in the hospital emergen cy room when we didn't yet 
have any clear information about the disease.  
During the lockdown, prostitutes could not continue their activity. Most of them are in 
furnished hotels, some in their own homes. Very quickly they accumulated debts, had 
no food to eat. I had a the phone numbers of all these people and the CSO asked me t o 
telework, to call them one by one to make a social assessment: those who have minimum 
social benefits, and the foreigners, without papers, who have nothing at all. I was 
annoyed: I don't know how many I had to call, but the CSO had nothing to offer them.  I 
had to shout at my manager - they were adding violence to violence. Finally it accessed 
food aid and we organized a distribution once a week. And state service vouchers, but 
the CSO wanted to impose limits: people with minimum social benefits, or not...  I also 
had to respond to requests for information on the disease, reassure, remind people of 
sanitary gestures, even help them to fill in the certificates [mandatory to go outside 
during the lockdown], it was complicated. Some people had to organize schoo l 
assistance for their child.  
What struck me during this period was the violence. Four Nigerian women were raped, 
over a whole weekend, by fifteen Nigerian men confined to the same building. I was the 
one who took charge of them when they called on Monday morning. My head of 
department  had just arrived, she didn't know how to work on these issues, so she put 
me on the case. I took them to the emergency room. During the journey, the aggressors 
kept calling them, threatening them. They organize human trafficking here for sexual 
exploitati on. These acts of violence, of rape, are part of the hold, to submit you. That's 
how they took advantage of the confinement. There have been other cases reported. 
With this number of aggressors, we had to be vigilant ourselves.  
Afterwards I accompanied them to file a complaint. The police first said that we had to 
wait until the end of the lockdown '' and my director was going to accept that! I contacted 
a policewoman I knew, and finally another director of the police said: '''You're going to 
take the case, and moreover in flagrante delicto ''. Afterwards, we rehoused the girls in 
emergency accommodation and made sure they had food. Then one of them was was 
spotted, towards the end, so I had to find a shelter in another town that was a ble to take 
them in and give them food without asking too many questions.  
There were no facilities for women victims of violence at the time, although their 
numbers were exploding! Other women were victims of violence from their partners. 
One of them called us, but there were no shelters... Sometimes I'm afraid but I know 
what I  have to do, I know how violent these guys are. But we did it, we are tired but we 
did it. These are very strong moments that I won't forget.  
When the head of the department with whom we did the confinement resigned after a 
 
 
   180 
 
year, the new manager changed our work, without discussion, from one day to the next: 
we had to take an interest in minors because there were subsidies to be had. She sent 
us to raise awareness, to inform other educators, to sell the CSO''s training courses! In 
April I caught covid, it lasted a week. When I came back, the occupational doctor  told 
me: '''No, you are not going to go back there ''. All my colleagues were on sick leave, we 
all resigned. I was depressed, taking medication.  
My girlfriend also worked at the CSO, we were face to face, teleworking, talking about 
the same situations, in disagreement sometimes, sometimes things flared up. I said we 
had to stop this. We also supported each other. If she hadn't been there, I don't k now 
how I would have got through the year alone, with more alcohol than usual in the 
evening. I didn't see my son much during the confinement. His mother sometimes 
wanted to take a breather, but I couldn't see him, my girlfriend and I were working.  
Finally, what made me feel good was that the girls' aggressors were arrested, there was 
a trial, and the girls started to work on reparation. I think I was present, useful, a lot, for 
these people.""","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,"doctors, the misinformation, it added fear"
United States,"""I am 33, I''m a single woman, and I work in a CSO on family planning.  
On the whole, it was a period that made me realize how privileged I was. I was confined 
to a very pleasant environment, a shared rental. I was able to continue my work both 
teleworking and face -to-face, so I kept in touch. I  found it very comfortable not to have 
children, to be very autonomous . There was a lot of talk during this period about people 
who live with their families, with several people in very small spaces, and about issues of 
intra -family violence.  
I'm a bit overwhelmed by these issues and at the same time I'm also angry because of 
the implementation of control tools like the health pass. I had quite a few moments of 
sadness and anger and powerlessness in relation to the massive state policies. But t here 
have been good moments when I was able to go to demonstrations where questions of 
politics and struggles were still important. But it's true that this is a complex period.  
I'm quite happy that were able to keep on receiving people in my CSO. During the first 
week of the lockdown we were completely closed and after that we opened in a very 
limited way: one afternoon a week, maybe two, but we still were open . We wanted to 
maintain the activity as much as possible. We have an email address,  and we extended 
the chat rooms. All our school actions were cancelled at that time.  
Then, in 2020 and 2021, there were major difficulties in terms of funding because we 
were unable to implement actions. Some funders wanted all the money to be 
reimbursed, whereas a lot of time was spent programming and re -programming actions 
that did not t ake place. And so it was a difficult period for the structure and the 
management and the Board of Directors.  
The people who come to the family planning service are mostly women, and they come 
to us because of the risks of pregnancy, for contraception, abortion and pregnancy tests. 
I've been working here for five years and we've noticed that over the years the que stion 
of violence and situations of great insecurity have become more and more present, so 
it's difficult to see what is specifically linked to covid. There are also more and more 
people in migrant or exile situations who have great difficulty in accessing  care, but it's 
difficult to quantify.  
 
 
    
 
During this period access to abortion was difficult. I had people on the phone who said 
to me '''but I can't... people go to hospital to die, the hospital is overloaded, we can't 
burden them...'' Some people felt difficulty in asserting their freedom, their rights. It was 
also very difficult for minors because they didn't go to school. Coming to the pl anning 
office or having an abortion or getting contraception works when it's on the way to 
school or college. But when there's no school or college, it's not pos sible. What excuse 
is there to leave the house? It was complicated.  Access to health care was really difficult 
during this period. Covid reinforced inequalities and situations of poverty and 
precariousness, so it also plays a role in the issues of menstru al precariousness.  
There was less solidarity among CSOs, because we couldn't see each other, that we 
limited meetings, that we limited group things. What was most lacking were the links 
among victims of violence or people  in a precarious situation. It is difficult afterwards to 
create a community, or support or just to create a link. Some groups have had to stop. 
There are also sanitary protocol issues, so how many people can attend? And the 
difficulty for people to return  to the social center for fear of covid. That deepened  forms 
of isolation. After the lock -down, people didn''t come back immediately. It took a while. 
This absence was super scary: what is not being said? What requests for help can't 
emerge because people are confined? There were few people because people just  
didn't go out at that time. On the other hand, the number of calls to the national helpline 
increased enormously.  
The Social Security offices are still closed and only available by telephone. They are 
difficult reach. For people who have little command of French and who are in an irregular 
situation, it's really very complicated! I don't see why they don''t reopen. Thi s raises issues 
of public policy and of the investment in public services. This is really a political choice. 
The same goes for the Departmental Council where it was also a disaster in terms of 
access. It was closed for a long time even though it has decis ive social missions.  
Nevertheless, we have tested our ability to adapt and seen that we manage to adapt to 
a lot... ""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",1,center for fear of covid. That deepened
United States,"""I am 32 and I was finishing my doctoral thesis when covid appeared. I lived 
at the time in a small village in France with my partner and our baby girl, born during the 
first lockdown. I had finished my doctoral contract and I was on unemployment benefits 
until September of that year. So, from March onwards, I was looking for work. I hadn't 
found a teaching position, so I was a bit discouraged about going into research. And as 
the funds were running out, I wanted to find a job to feed us. I had w orked in sales before, 
but with the coronavirus, there were no offers. So I was a bit stuck. I had made offers in 
other fields, but they told me that they were getting rid of staff rather than hiring them. 
So my partner and I got a bit worried. We were ver y lucky. Just before the crisis started, 
she had trained as a nurse. Before that, she worked in the restaurant business. For 
nurses, at least during the coronavirus, there was work. So that reassured us. Fortunately, 
I had almost finished writing my thesis  in February, I was well advanced. In fact, the 
coronavirus crisis slowed down the organization of the rest of the work: the time for 
proofreading, for setting up the jury and all that. Then I had a few cosmetic changes to 
make during the summer but the ma in part was done in December. That wasn't a big 
 
 
     
 
problem but was a bit stressful.  
The additional element that complicated things a little bit, but also made them more 
beautiful, was that my partner, in March, was eight months pregnant. So we were 
expecting a baby girl who was due in April. The lockdown complicated the delivery. It 
was v ery hard for her because, at the maternity hospital, I couldn't stay with her. It was 
forbidden. I was able to stay only 4 hours after the birth. Afterwards, she spend five days 
alone. For me it was hard, but you could say that it's classic. But for my par tner, it was 
really difficult because she was all alone. Then in hospital, there are doctors... let's say 
that kindness is not always there. I also felt a bit guilty, so these feelings were a bit 
complicated.  
Luckily, we were in the countryside, so we had a very low rent, we had 615' rent plus 
50' for electricity. But with 1000' income between the two of us, with the little one and 
everything, we didn't really see how we could manage. But we were really lucky. First, 
the government voted to continue unemployment benefits. That really did us a lot of 
good. The second piece of luck was that we lived in the countryside, not very far from 
my father, who is a retired bricklayer. He's 75 years old but a bit addicted t o work. He 
proposed that I take on some small projects with him where there was physical work that 
he couldn't do and that I could do, under the table, of course. I'm all for paying social 
security contributions, but there are times when you can't really d o anything else. So we 
were really lucky, it was great.  
Originally, we had decided that my partner would stay at home for a while, maybe take 
a year's parental leave, while I worked. But as I didn't have a job, and she could find a 
job in a flash, she went to work in a small country hospital that was 10 minutes  away from 
our house. I was able to keep the baby, it was really great, we really wanted to keep her 
at home. From an economic point of view, it was more or less the same cost as putting 
her in a nursery. We had thought about it for a long time because we are both partisans 
of a constant reflection on gender issues because we realize that there are always... that 
we reproduce mechanisms so we try to watch them, but we can easily fall back into them. 
In fact with the coronavirus crisis she was the only one w ho could find work. So there was 
quite a strong feeling of failure that was a bit complicated to deal with. We had the 
impression of having failed. I don't know if it's a factor, but we have a family model where 
my father was the one who earned the most mo ney when we were... It's good, it allowed 
me to think a little bit about these things that ruin your life. It caused me some anxiety 
on that side. It was the change of plans that was difficult.  
There was a general uncertainty that was not improved by the context, and people were 
not in a very good mood. There was quite a lot of anxiety in fact. I'm not naturally very 
anxious but I was worried about the expenses...Some problems got worse with covi d. 
We often talked with friends, for example from North Africa, who had problems finding 
work even before covid. And during the covid they found themselves facing a kind of 
closure and hostility. It's complicated. My partner... as she is from the Philippin es, she 
looks like a person from the Philippines... There was a kind of sino -phobia. At that time 
we got all kinds of remarks... But also support, people who said: '''You hear what they say 
about the Chinese, I don't agree ''. She's not Chinese, but she's labelled like that. In crisis 
situations like that, sometimes people let go of their inhibitions. When I think about it, I 
wonder what can be attributed to the coronavirus or not... ""

United States,"""I am 76, I have no children and and I live alone. I am retired but I used to 
work for a medical journal.  
The impact of the lockdown was more about my age, and about being alone. It was the 
year I turned 75. During the first lockdown, I really slipped...  With two friends who live 
alone not far from here, we sometimes saw each other during the time we were all owed 
out, we walked a bit. But to be alone when I used to have cultural and physical activities... 
Before covid, the group, the exchanges helped me a lot in terms of energy. Then 
everything was cut off all at once... At the beginning we couldn't even be in  each other's 
homes. It was hard because being like that, when you're not used to being alone, without 
any activity, just feeding yourself wasn't enough. I started to take refuge in reading. I've 
never watched so much television, I started to close myself off a bit, to shift my 
mealtimes, to shift my sleep times and I gradually sank into a kind of depression.  
 I only have a narrow balcony. I walked in the streets but that's not a walk. I compare with 
 
 
     
 
my friends who had a house, a garden, who were not alone. They told me about their 
lives and that also depressed me because I was really feeling solitude. I had to go to the 
doctor, I had to take medication. It made me realise that I hadn't solved all my existential 
problems and my childhood problems too. It made things come up again. I was really 
unwell. I really went through a process of .... closing in on myself. There are quite a few 
of us. Two friends had the same thing. A lot of people took it in thei r stride though.  
It was scary. We saw ourselves going into old age with all that it entails. It's as if you no 
longer have any autonomy. I used to go to the swimming pool, but I haven't even been 
back since, no way. I don't even feel like it anymore. Even with my close fri ends I didn't 
feel like talking for long. Everyone saw it, everyone understood it. Even now I'm more 
fragile, I've remained more fragile.  
I must also say that I used to work in the medical field, so from the beginning I had all 
the information, even what was not on television.  So I was a bit more freaked out than 
other people. My former colleagues talked about what they experienced in hospi tal on 
a daily basis and it's true that at the beginning it was absolutely... they were really...  They 
were afraid, they didn't say it, but they were afraid! They were afraid that their teams 
would give up and leave, and that they would end up with an inf lux of patients who were 
dying like flies during the first month. They didn't even know what they were dying of, at 
first. The information from China was only partly true. I was more aware of it maybe than 
other people, because my ex -colleagues were seeing  the most serious cases. They were 
telling me: '''Be careful, be careful ''. We didn't have masks, so I put on a little scarf but 
given my age... Afterwards I went shopping with a mask. We didn't have FFP2s at the 
time. Some German friends sent me some, which was very nice. They were really FFP2 
masks because I could hardly breathe with them. When I went into a place, into the 
pharmacy for example, I put it on, not for very long.  
Now it's fine. I got a bit more organised afterwards. I think it was during the second 
lockdown that I went to a friend's house. This virus played tricks on us: we believed that 
this was it,  that we were getting to the end. And now we know that we'll have to live with 
it, that we'll always have variants. I'm vaccinated, but I won't see the whole planet 
completely vaccinated in my lifetime.  
I really missed seeing the younger generation. Especially children, it's true that ....  
WhatsApp is OK but it doesn't replace meeting them. I prefer the telephone, hearing 
just the voice, you can hear well. But not not being able to kiss them...It was bet ter once 
I was vaccinated though. The vaccine was a bit of a disappointment, but for the severe 
forms, if we hadn't had it, it would have been a massacre. I also thought of myself as 
contributing to collective immunity, so I did it right away.  
 I don't want to get into arguments about vaccination, especially with the people I love, 
but I have old friends who are stubborn about it. I have a good friend who is a GP and 
even her children are not vaccinated. I joke about it with my godson who isn''t vaccinated, 
because I know I'll never get really angry with him. Life is really... At my age you think 
'''I've seen it all ''. But I didn't know it was so hard. Or else it was abstract. So there you 
are.""","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",1,"I am 76, I have no children"
United States,"""I am 33 and I am a nurse. I have a partner, François, and a small baby born 
during the first lockdown. I now work in a nursing home outside a city in the south of 
France.  
I was working in a small hospital at the time of the first lockdown. I was on a one -year 
 
 
     
 
contract and I had just found out that I was pregnant when it started. I worked until the 
7th month, when the lockdown started. At that time, there was still no sign of covid in my 
area. A month later, it started to appear. So I avoided that stressful moment at the 
beginning. When I stopped work, things went well for me. François and I lived in  a small 
village in the countryside, so we were more or less naturally confined. There are 2,000 
inhabitants in the village, so apart from shopping at the bakery and the little supermarket 
on the corner, we were confined. And with the pregnancy, I was a bit more careful too.  
When the baby was born, with the hospital health protocols, her father was allowed in 
during the birth but not afterwards. I felt a bit helpless, because I was on my own. I had 
to stay in for five days, which was a bit longer than usual because the baby lo st weight. 
And Jean couldn't really visit me, not even for half an hour during the day. It was 
complicated. I felt very alone. Jean couldn't come and enjoy the first days either. 
Breastfeeding was a bit difficult at the beginning, I didn't really know if i t was going to 
work or not. At the beginning, I didn't know if I could leave her for a few seconds to go 
to the toilet. In the beginning, you don't know at all. It would have been nice if François 
had been there, he would have watched her while I went to t he toilet. I didn't take a 
shower for 3 -4 days because I was afraid to leave. I had Jean on the phone, but it wasn't 
the same.  
I breastfed the baby for 7 months, so there wasn't the expense of infant milk. I had 
bought cloth nappies from Vinted, so I didn't have any nappy expenses either. Now I'm 
no longer breastfeeding her but she's still drinking milk - it's expensive. We didn't  see 
much of François's family after the baby''s birth because we were afraid for them. We 
went to see his parents but we stayed in the street and they stayed on their balcony.  
François was looking for work, but he received a lot of rejections. We wondered what 
would happen to us. That affected our morale a bit, we said to ourselves, well, what are 
we going to do? So I went back to work at the hospital. When I went back, my colle agues 
told me that it had been a horrible time, very stressful, you could feel that they had been 
through something. They said to me, thank God you weren't there at the time.  
When I got back, they were on 12 -hour shifts. Before, we were doing 8 hour shifts. The 
worst thing about the 12 hours was that instead of 3 nurses, we only had one nurse 
working all day long. We were short of nurses and the atmosphere in the team was 
degra ded because the nurses' aides wanted to stay at 8 hours. And the manager had 
put us on 12 hours - all the nurses but not the aides, to avoid conflict.  
It was new for us nurses to do the 12 hours. There is a day shift and a night shift. There 
was no longer a junction between teams. And the cadies  came in at the old time because 
they had kept their 8 hours. We arrived afterwards and we didn''t know what had 
happened during the night, obviously. And with the 12 -hour shifts, we're not there all 
the time, we'll have 3 days of work and then 3 days of re st. We have to catch up on all 
the information we didn't get during those three days. And there was a bad atmos phere 
between the manager and the employees because they didn't agree, that created 
camps. I was happy to leave at that time because I didn't expect to find an atmosphere 
like that.  
Things are really not back to normal and I feel that the teams were a bit broken by this, 
by the covid, by the health protocols, by the fact of changing to 12 -hour shifts precisely 
during the covid. In fact, they took advantage of the circumstances to pass  everyone to

United States,"""I'm 74 years old, a widow, I live with my disabled daughter, age 38, who has 
myopathy. I had a stroke in 2016 and breast cancer last year. I mustn''t carry weights. 
Iused to be a worker in a textile factory, then the factory closed and I got a job as a 
cleaning women at the police station.  
Just before lockdown, I lost my dad, I lost my mum, I lost my dog... everything was gone, 
we were scared, that's for sure, no family, nothing, but friends yes... We're strong, we're 
really strong, we've never sunk. I've had trouble crying since all that, b ut sometimes 
when my daughter wanted to cry, I'd let her cry, it would do her good, but I didn't want 
to, she'd make me sink.  
We have a home care service. It's an association we've been with for six years. There are 
people who come for the night, to look after my daughter, since my since my stroke in 
2016, then in the morning, there's a person from 8.30am to 1pm and from 2pm to 8 pm. 
That's in the best case, because we don't always have the people we need. In the 
summer we go out if the weather is good, but since Covid we've been isolated, we've 
been very isolated... Normally, we have someone 24 hours a day, but, the day before 
yesterday and yesterday evening it was me who did the nights, eh, there was nobody... 
I've got someone tonight and tomorrow but on Friday I've still got no one and then on 
Saturday and Sunday I'll have someone. Not on Monday and Tuesday because one of 
them le ft without giving notice or anything...  
There were already a lot of stoppages, - people not replaced, - but I've never seen 
stoppages like now. And it's badly managed. When they need someone urgently in 
another sector, they take my daughter''s help since they don't have enough staff. They 
say, we ll, her mother's there, she's going to do it... - Yes, that's the big problem... it's 
badly managed and as soon as we say something, they threaten to drop us and tell us 
to look for something else. The last young girl who came, she's 19, she's as thin as m y 
little finger. She was a waitress in a McDonald's before. That's it, they put in people who 
have no experience, no training, so there you go. She's all self -effacing, all embarrassed, 
I can't see her lifting Emilie. She was only shown the apparatus to li ft people once, then 
they told her, well, on Saturday and Sunday you're going to do it on your own! For a 
disabled person, what is she going to be able to do? It's nonsense, it's putting her in 
danger, she's in the wrong position, and then the disabled per son is put in danger too, 
it's a responsibility. They're told to do the tracheotomy, without training... Since Covid 
it's even worse because so many people have left, they haven't been replaced and they 
can't manage to recruit people for both day and night  shifts. And between us, they only 
find foreigners because the French don't want to work.  
At first, they didn't even talk about protective measures for covid, it was up to us to train 
them in this, it was up to us to provide the masks. They thought we were a nuisance 
because we just asked for protective measures... we were too demanding. We wer e 
afraid to have someone at home at night, so we said, well, for two months, I could do the 
job...We were so afraid of having someone come to our house at night, that we said they 
could come for 2 hours, put my daughter to bed and then leave. But they were  paid in

full. Another time one girl spent a day at our place, and the next day she had Covid! We 
had to change everything, clean everything she had touched, get tested, have the nurse 
come, it's taking risks for us... But during the 2nd lockdown, they arrived in gowns, 
goggles, gloves, overshoes, the whole shebang, and they stayed 6 hours like that, l ike 
the Miami Experts.  
We don't go out any more, like going to a restaurant, we don't feel safe. We say to 
ourselves that it's not going to last forever, it's going to end, but we don't dare go out 
too much. ""","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",1,"74 years old, a widow, I live"
Greece,"I am a 21 year old transgender man. I am in the process of transitioning. I 
always felt that I was male although I was born female. I have a twin brother and I live 
with my mother. My mother raised me as a girl and still calls me with my girly name. Most 
of the people in my family call me by my girly name, but my friends they have accepted 
me as a man. I have spent the first lock down in my house. It was my last year in high 
school and I had to study to pass the exams to enter the University, I wanted to st udy 
sociology, social policy or anthropology, but I didn't write very well in the exams. All my 
generation was really unlucky because we had to do online teaching both for school and 
for private tuition classes. It did not work for me very well. I could no t concentrate. Being 
in the house all the time was not possible so I was going for long walks with friends who 
live in the same neighbourhood of Athens. We were all tired all the time and we missed 
bars, dancing, parties, fun in general. I passed the exams  and started studying at the 
University in a smalltown outside Athens. I did not move there because the year  I started 
the University, I only went there to register and a new lock down was announced by the 
government. All classes were online and it was ve ry difficult it meet other students, make 
friends, meet the professors. It was all online. The only good thing about this was that I 
did not have to travel or move there which reduced the costs. However, I did not do very 
well during the exams. Now that th e lock downs have been lifted I have rented a small 
room near the University and live there. It is much better for me although there were still 
some classes that were done online. I have met some students and know what my 
professors look like fully not jus t their faces. WE can also go out for coffee or drinks and 
meet in houses to watch movies, play games, drink, have parties. I am mostly interested 
in other LGBTQ persons and I like girls. I identify as a man but I have not transitioned 
fully yet. I have no t done a surgery but I am taking hormones and I am hiding my breast. 
I think I look like a boy or a man. My female looks are gone. I have been doing 
psychotherapy for the past six years, ever since I told my family. My mother was socked 
but through therapy  she has managed to understand a lot of things. In Greece, the 
parents are not very supportive. Also, my brother is not very supportive. My friends are 
very nice about it and very cool about it. It is a generational issue. In my age group if you 
are not a fascist, you are part of this culture even if you are not gay. I had a girlfriend 
when the lock downs started but she lived far away and we could not see each other 
often. We were not allowed to move outside the area where we live and she lived far 
away. O nce I cycled to her place. But it was not possible to keep that relationship and so 
we split up. Since I started the University, my life has improved a lot. I didn't like the 
isolation. Especially for a person like me who has a difficult relationship with their family 
it was difficult to be locked inside a house with my mother and brother. I didn't really talk 
to them a lot and just spend a lot of time online. But we didn't have fights, we were fine 
with each other. It was not pleasant, but it was not diffi cult either.  I am thinking that the 
greatest problem that I had was all this online teaching that made me feel really tired

and missing my friends. I am hoping that from now and on I will not have to relive lock 
downs again.","['Education', 'Identity']",0,I am thinking that the greatest problem
United States,"I am a 52 year old single mother. I have two children and a dog. I am twice 
married. I divorced the first one after a year, and the second one died. I am a widow. My 
second husband was great, I was really in love with him, but got cancer and died within 
a period of two years. My son was 5 years old at the time and my daughter 1 year old. 
My son was traumatised,  and I had to take him to a child phycologist.  I had three difficult 
problems to deal with during the pandemic. First of all, my son was at his final year in 
school during the second year of the pandemic and he was preparing for the University. 
He was a very good student and wanted to study maths. However, the lock downs forced 
all children in Greece to do classes online and after Christmas  he collapsed and told me 
that he did not want to study or pass the exams. I got really upset;  I didn't know what to 
do with him. He drove me crazy, we had a lot of fights. And when you are a single mother 
you have to be in charge of everything, take decis ions on your own and deal with the 
children's problems without support. My boyfriend has a good relationship with him but 
he could not help us. My son managed to pass to the university but in a field that he does 
not really like. He is not sure if he wants  to study and wants to start working instead. But 
for me this is not an option, so I am trying to convince him to try and go to the town 
outside Athens where his university  is. But it is a struggle and we fight all the time. He 
prefers to be at home, sleep  all day and go out with his friends at night. The lock downs 
in Greece were very hard. We were not even allowed to move from one area to the other. 
My work had to move online.  I am teaching English and I was used to be outside the 
house all day. The fights with my son were intense and made me wat to leave the house 
but I was not allowed to. At the same time, the government changed the law for the entry 
to the Universities and m ade it harder, leaving many schools without students. This was 
a blow for us. He  would have passed in a better school if it wasn't for this government 
that punished students who went through the lock downs. The second problem that I 
had was my boyfriend who has a weird attitude towards the virus. He is not afraid to 
catch it and he is  careless. During the first year of the lockdowns we split up because of 
this problem. I was really scared because my daughter's health is fragile, has an 
 
 
     
 
autoimmune disease. I was afraid that she would be infected. We split up after the fights 
and I was really depressed for a while, but then we got back together and spent the 
second year of the lock down together. This was helpful. I did not have serious financial 
problems because my classes increased during the pandemic.  When teaching in 
schoo ls went online, it got worse and parents sought private tuition to ensure that their 
children did not stay behind. But my biggest problem was that I had all these iss ues tod 
real with on my own, while I was locked inside a house without being able to leave. I had 
all these fights and I am not sure if it was me because of the menopause or if my son and 
my boyfriend are the problem. My daughter is great, we never have fi ghts, she takes care 
of herself, is independent and really nice to me. But she too is caught into these fights. 
Family relations become too complicated when you are in house without being able to 
go out with friends, to have a nice time. I drink a lot and try to stay calm by doing yoga, 
but it is difficult.  I have started one month ago to go to a psychologist because my nerves 
were very tense and I was unhappy.  This helps me deal with disagreements with my son 
and boyfriend. The third problem is that we g ot a dog in the house. She is sweet but it is 
not something I wanted. It was a present for my daughter and it worked out fine during 
the lock downs because she would wake up and take her for a walk and then come back 
and start her classes online. But now t hat she goes to school normally, I am the one who 
has to take care of her and it adds to my workload. The dog needs training, but we 
cannot afford it. Before the lock downs, there was a lady that came to our house three 
times a week, cleaned, cooked and to ok care of the children when I was working. She 
was very important for us, like an aunt to the children, but I asked her to stop coming to 
the house when the pandemic started. The children are old enough to take care of 
themselves, but for me this increase s the pressures because I have to cook, clean, and 
take care of things. Doing the work that she did is difficult. This is my life and is has 
worsened a lot because of Covid .","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,I had all these fights and I
United States,"I am from Albania but live in Greece for many years now. I was an engineer 
in my home country, but when the regime changed, the factory closed and I was left 
without a job. I had worked all my life ever since I finished the university. I had a young 
son at  the time and so we decided with my husband to move to Greece. When we moved 
 
 
     
 
here, I started working as a cleaner in houses.  At first the salary was very small, but then 
I got good clients and loyal ones who pay me well. At first I was disappointed to work in 
this area, but in Greece there is no other type of job available for us Albanian women. 
Merdaughter in law does the same job although she was born in Greece. I have a  grand 
son who lives with us and is in the lyceum. he is a very good student and my hope is that 
he will have a different life because he has Greek citizenship. I  will work for the rest of my 
life as a cleaner in Greek houses. My husband worked in a factory in Greece, but he got 
asthma from the fumes and couldn't work anymore. He never got compensation or 
anything else. So in the house we live with my son's family,  the two of us, my son, his wife 
and my grandson. We have a very large house in Piraeus. We bought it few years ago 
with all our savings, and also have a house in Albania, where we go during the summer. 
I will probably move there when I will no longer be a ble to work. I will get a pension from 
Albania because I pay national insurance contributions there. I also pay here in Greece 
for the Greek card. When Covid  started, I got really scared because I was afraid that if I 
catch it I will pass it on to my husband who has asthma and he might suffer. I was very 
careful and always took care to sanitise everything, wear a mask, make sure that I am not 
in the same room as my employers. However, my greatest problem is that my employers 
are not as careful. They expect me to wear a mask and keep everything sanitised, but 
they do not wear a mask. The worse is one of my oldest clients, who is a 76 year old 
woman with health problems (cancer), who does not want to get vaccinated. Her son 
convinced her that it will be bad fo r her and so she doesn't even listen to her doctor. This 
is completely irrational and makes me feel really insecure. I keep telling her, because 
now we are friendly, that she needs to get vaccinated but she does not listen. She even 
organised dinners for h er friends, who are the same age but vaccinated, and asked me 
to help her. I refused. For me being in a house with a large group of people is risky and 
I don't want to risk it because of my husband. If I catch it, he will too. During the 
pandemic, we were all in the house one day because it was the lock down and we were 
not allowed to move and he felt bad. We took him to hospital because he couldn't 
breathe. We thought that it was asthma, but it was his heart. He had a heart attack. Now 
we are even more car eful, but my work makes it very difficult to be careful because the 
clients ignore us. They do not care about our health. They only protect themselves. When 
the lock downs started, all five of us stayed at home. My son who works in an office 
workers remote ly, me and his wife couldn't work because we are both cleaners, my 
husband is unemployed and ill and my grandson was still at school doing remote work. 
Most of my clients did not pay me during this time, but there was one client who put 
money into my accou nt regularly although I didn't go to clean in her house. Just because 
I was working for her and did a really good job, she thought that she should put money 
in my account even if I wasn't working. But she was the only one. Also, I could go and 
work for thi s client that was unvaccinated and went there once a week because she lives 
close by to where I live. So I would send a message ""support to a person in need"" and 
would walk to her house. But was unlucky because she was the only unvaccinated client 
that I h ave. All the others are vaccinated and their children are too. For me this was the 
biggest problem. It gave me a lot of anxiety because I was thinking of my husband. I 
didn't want to be the one who would bring Covid  to him. Now that the lock downs are 
over, I am in more danger because clients are not careful. I also take the bus and it is 
 
 
   196 
 
very crowded and this is another sources of anxiety for me. I regret that I never took a 
driver's license because we have my husband's car but we never use it because he is ill 
now. I usually go on holiday in August for two weeks in Albania, but last summer my 
husband said to me ""Just leave them and let's go to meet our relatives and our frien ds"". 
So, I left for two months and many of my clients were disappointed. But my husband had 
this operation and wanted to do it so I left the clients without cleaning. It was good for 
me because I relaxed, spend time with relatives in Albania. It was really nice after all this 
time that we were isolated in our home. I am lucky because I have a family that we 
support each other. I never felt that we lacked anything, altho ugh me and my son's wife 
were not working. My son could take care of us. Because we live in the same house, it is 
easier to share and we spend less money because of that. My grandson got addicted to 
video games and was sleeping all day and playing all nigh t. He never went out and now 
that's schools started he got ill and we had to take him to hospital too. He got  
appendicitis and missed many days from school.  He has missed a lot of classes and 
cannot wake up in the morning. He is a good kid but he is no l onger doing well at school. 
I speak with one of my clients who has children of the same age and she has the same 
problems. But again we share a lot and we go through all this together with my daughter 
in law. So I took time off to take care of the kid or m y husband when they were in hospital. 
In Albania the relationship between mother and daughter in law is very important and I 
am lucky to have such a nice daughter in law. And my son is great and I appreciate him 
even more now because he worked and supporte d us all during the pandemic. And he 
told me not to worry about the money and so I could go to Albania in the summer and 
have a vacation with my husband after so many years.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,I was very careful and always took
United States,"I am a live -out domestic worker from the Philippines working in Greece since 
2000. I am 45 years old and I came to Greece because I needed to find a job to support 
my family. I have a son who lives the Philippines. He is an adult now and studies. My 
husban d raised him. I was not there for most of his childhood. At first, I was a live in in a 
very rich house in Athens. Only recently I have become more independent. I rent my 
 
 
     
 
own apartment and clean different houses, including a former boss' house that I clean 
three times per week. I am glad that I was not working as a live -in during Covid -19 
because the pressure was tremendous for domestic workers. They had to be there for 
their bosses working continuously, cleaning and sanitizing the house, taking care of the 
kids and many of them were not even aloud to have days off. At the same time, I am not 
happy with how I ended up being without work and without an income during the lock 
downs. There were restrictions of movement in Athens and we were allowed to move 
only if necessary. We had to send a message and the police was checking if this was 
valid. For a period of time we were not allowed to move outside the area where we live. 
I ended up without an income during the pandemic because most of my bosses are 
located in the North of Athens in rich areas. I live in the centre of the city. When I started 
working again after the lock downs were lifted, I was afraid that I would get the vir us. I 
had to take the train with a friend of mine who works in the same area, but it is too 
crowded. Then I would go into other people's houses to clean, but they would often be 
there because they worked from home. I could not do the same thing. My bosses never 
paid me during lock downs because they pay for the service provided each time. If I do 
not provide the service, there is no payment.  This was the greatest problem I faced 
during the pandemic. I got the virus in November 2021. I am not sure where I g ot it from, 
probably from the train because no one else that I had met this week had a positive test. 
For me this was an additional blow because I had to stop working again and it cost me 
a lot. I am not a rich person. I had fever and it took me two weeks before I tested negative 
and could go back to work. It was hard.  I cannot afford that and in addition, I have to 
pay for my own national insurance contributions to get a residence permit. So this was a 
cost I had to pay, while there were lock downs, when I was ill and had no income. Covid 
19 was a crisis for me and for many people like me who are in domestic work because 
we lost a lot and now we have to start all over again and recover what we 've lost. In 
Greece, there are many migrant domestic workers an d nobody talks about us and what 
we have been through during Covid -19. We have our association KASAPI and we are in 
a better position than other domestic workers, we support each other, we are stronger. 
For us this was important during the lock downs becau se even when we couldn't go to 
work we had each other. I now feel strong again to work and regain what I lost, but I am 
thinking of looking for a live -in job again because the rent and electricity are very 
expensive. I did not have heating because it is to o expensive and the residents of the 
block of flats that I live in decided that they could not afford the petrol to hit the place. 
So I use electric heaters. We have a good network and I hope I will find one soon to move 
in with a family and make up for th e income that I lost during Covid .","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",0,am 45 years old and I came
United States,"I am a student, currently living in Thessaloniki. I come from a small village in 
the North of Greece from an agricultural family. My parents have a farm. They  have 
experienced many blows with the crops during the pandemic because of the bad 
weather (snow,  ice, rain). I am extremely worried because I think that climate change 
would change everything. I was worried about this issue before the pandemic, but now 
it has become more and more important. I am part of a group in my University that deals 
with environmental issues. We are mostly women in this group, students in science. We 
are a very small group. Most students do not care about the environment, they care 
about politics and gender based violence. My interest in the environment started when 
we had a presentation about climate change at school from a teacher that was really 
good explaining us these  issues. I then joined a group he created at school. This made 
me think of my life in a different way. I started to recycle, use the bicycle to comm ute and 
avoid plastic straws. I am not sure how the pandemic is linked to climate change, but 
there were some positive things that I experienced during lock downs. I am staying in an 
apartment with my flatmate and we realised that the cars stopped moving a nd there was 
 
 
     
 
no more noise and pollution. For me using a bicycle is much better because I exercise 
too, but for most people it only takes a pandemic to stop using their car. At the same 
time, however, the increase in extreme temperatures is a result of climate change that is 
much more important than the pandemic. We do not use central heating in my 
apar tment because we cannot afford it, and this is also in a sense about climate change. 
Being cold is something that I don't like and it was worse when we had to stay in the  
house all day because of the lock downs. In my opinion, women are more sensitive to 
environmental issues and are more aware of how climate change can affect our everyday 
lives. Most of the students in my group are women. I have two brothers and they are b oth 
living in Thessaloniki. At first when I arrived here, my older brother asked me to go and 
live with him. And I did. Because he was following my father's behaviour he was very 
controlling and wouldn't let me leave the house easily. He wanted to make sur e that I 
was safe, he told me. But it was oppressive. In January 2020, just when the pandemic 
started, I managed to leave his house and find an apartment with my friend and this 
saved my life because if I had to share a house with my brother, I would feel trapped. My 
brother is very judgmental. However, it is very difficult for my parents to support me so I 
work in a coffee shop to get money for my rent. I am not vaccinated and this causes a lot 
of problems in my university and at work because I have to get  a negative test each time 
I go there in order to get in the lecture rooms or to get to work. Also my brother is 
pushing me to get vaccinated. He thinks I am stupid. I don't believe in a vaccine that has 
not been tested for many years, I also don't like  t he fact that it is compulsory. I believe 
in eating well, exercising, taking vitamins and being outdoors. I also do yoga and I want 
to get a license to teach yoga to get an extra income because my parents are struggling. 
I study to get a license in Iyengar yoga. Most of the people in the studio where I go are 
unvaccinated. Maybe the vaccine is helpful for older people, but why should I do it? 
During the first months of the lock downs, I've spent a lot of time reading about 
environmental issues and now I thin k I am not too bad on this topic. I want to do a 
postgraduate course on these issues too. I think we should be closer to nature as women. 
I believe that our bodies are made for this as our menstrual cycles follow the earth. I am 
worried about climate chang e though, which affects also women and our bodies. What 
we put in our bodies is important and it all derives from the earth.","['Education', 'Domestic']",1,I am not vaccinated and this causes
United States,"I am 30 years old teaching religion in a Greek high school. I am very religious 
and very close to the Church in the area where I live in  a suburb of Athens. I live in the 
same building as my mother and I take care of my mother who is 75 years old and has 
cancer. My sister also lives in the same building. She is doing chemotherapy right now 
but all her life she took care of us. She was a sing le mother because our father left us and 
she was working as a cook in a kindergarten for many years until she got her pension. 
She is still cooking for us. I have not been married yet but I want to and I also want to 
have children. But so far my r elationships did not go very well in that direction. Men in 
Greece do not want to commit and have children because of the economic crisis. I was 
with my ex boyfriend for four years and we split up because he did not want to get 
married and have children. H e did not have a lot of money and did not want to spend 
the rest of his life poor. He felt that if he had children he would be poor, but from my 
perspective you become rich when you have children. I am very religious. I go to Church 
every Sunday and also t ry to teach children about religion in a way that is modern. I do 
not preach, I just tell them the basics so they know and then they can decide for 
themselves. Many people, young people turn to religion now in Greece. My mother was 
not religious, and I hav e found religion on my own. I wanted to pass to the school of 
 
 
      
 
literature but I did not make it and went to the religious school of the University of Athens 
instead. That is where I learnt more about it. During the pandemic, I had a lot of problems 
because the government was not very supportive of the Church. At first they closed the 
Churches and it was very difficult for us who are Christians to get in touch with our 
communities. We couldn't even go to Church on Easter. I live near a Church and I could 
hear the chants, but couldn't go there to light a candle. Then the  Churches opened but 
with limitations that are not good for the Church. I know many people talk against 
sharing a teaspoon to get the communion, but for me this is not an issue because it is 
the blood of Christ. We even have scientists who said so in the s cientific committee for 
Covid . I am against vaccination for religious reasons. In my congregation, the priest does 
not talk about it and most people are vaccinated, but I read online and I don't agree with 
compulsory vaccinations. I do not want to judge pe ople but this aa poison that they put 
into their bodies. This is another reasons I split with my boyfriend. We split during the 
summer of 2021. We were on vacation and we were always fighting about vaccinations 
and children and family. He was religious but  not with the Church. For me not being 
vaccinated makes my life very complicated because I have to do testing for everything. 
Even to go to a shop, you need a certificate of vaccination or test  that you are not Covid 
positive. The same if you want to go to  work or the Church, although this is not actually 
implemented. One of the problems I faced during the lock downs was protecting myself 
and my mother who has cancer from getting infected. We had to be careful, although I 
believe that God protected us. Now I am going to school and I afraid that I will catch it 
from one of my students and bring it back to my mother. It makes me anxious but getting  
vaccinated is not the answer. During the pandemic I had to cook, take my mother to 
hospitals and doctors for her treatment, clean her house and be with her whenever she 
needed me. My sister did the same and we were together in this. For me giving to the 
elderly is a rich experience and by giving to her I give back things to myself, I become 
richer by taking care of m y mother. It is not at all a burden for me. This is what daughters 
are for.  I do not think that men and women are unequal and that there are gender 
inequalities. I think that men and women are different and we should respect those 
differences. I believe t hat women should work but also have the time to care about the 
children more than men. I don't think that care should be shared between men and 
women. I am not a feminist. But I think it is terrible that we hear now in Greece about 
rapes and biting and fem icides. It is all over the news. I think during the pandemic people 
got depressed and angry and this led them to turn against their wives. I did not grow up 
with a father so for me this is not something I have experienced. And with my boyfriends 
it was the  same, we did not live in the same house. I am against violence as a Christian.","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,I faced during the lock downs was
Greece,"I am 65 years old. I am a retired nurse. I am very active in labour unionism 
and I continue to support the actions of labour unions of healthcare workers in Greece. 
We have been hit severely be the economic crisis. The sector is understaffed. It was 
unders taffed before the pandemic but now the situation has become explosive. There 
are no occupational doctors to check the health of nurses. They are under a lot of stress 
and exhausted physically after so many years fighting against Covid . Our society should 
react, should protest. It is not right to cheer and clap for medical staff and then do 
nothing about the over exhaustion of healthcare workers who have no government 
support. And this is a feminist issue because most of the nurses we are women. I am a 
femin ist and have been in feminist groups since the 1980s. For me this very important to 
be active and follow a cause. I have spend most of the pandemic dealing with the labour 
issues of nurses, trying to support and spread the word. But also, I have been very active 
in the me too movement, since it has started. For me gender based violence is equally 
important to the virus. The me too movement has brought this into the news, the TV 
channels and the newspapers. But for as a feminist this was always there in the darkness. 
I have been to all demonstrations about this and I feel that I get strength from this. 
Women in Greece are oppressed and many of them are victims of violence.  I am 
divorced and I have not been a victim of violence but I feel that I have to strug gle for all 
the other women. I have been also in demonstrations outside courts that were dealing 
with cases of GBV during the pandemic. For me this did not stop because of the virus. I 
kept going. I am vaccinated, I was wearing my mask and I did something I believe in. For 
me it is not important to go to the bouzkia (Greek traditional music) or to eat in a 
restaurant. For me this is important, it is what kept me going and I never felt lonely during 
lock downs because of these feminist causes: the nurses and  gender based violence. I 
have also two cats that keep me company. I do not need men. I am divorced for many 
years. I have to say that the virus worried my mostly because I was thinking about the 
women who work in hospitals and about the women who were loc ked inside houses with 
violent husbands, fathers, or boyfriends. This is what worried me and I felt that I had to 
do something about it. Feminism is about care and about violence. Both are important. 
During the pandemic, I had spent some weeks when I didn' t leave the house at all. I was 
inside the house online most of the time, having meetings with the groups I am working 
with. This was important because I am that kind of person, I feel stronger when I struggle 
about causes I believe in. I think it is not t he same if you care more about your family. But 
I do not have children and my cats are not something to worry about. I feel old and at 
the same time young because although there were lock downs, I feel like I managed to 
keep doing what makes me active. I t hink that feminism has gained a lot during the 
pandemic. We have gained strength because we kept struggling to get things right. 
 
 
   206 
 
Younger women have joined to struggle and we are now a lot. We do not always agree 
older and younger feminists but we are together and this is what matters. So I think 
overall although the pandemic was a very dark moment for women and women's 
freedom, it was also for Greece at least an important moment because feminists have 
gained stren gth.","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",2,"person, I feel stronger when I struggle"
United States,"""To sum it up, my name is Luna, I am 69, retired after working as a librarian 
with an MA degree, fighting cancer, and recently married. As you know how miserable 
the pensions in Croatia are, I can tell you that mine is 3500 KN (475 EUR), and I could 
hardly  survive if I were living alone.  Especially now, with this devastating diagnosis. Even 
both our pensions do not cover all the expenses. The house is quite big, we have 5 pets, 
and, as we live in a village near Zagreb, we are lost without a car.  We nurture it like a 
baby '' it is 20 years old and needs regular visits to the mechanic. We now buy less 
expensive food, and also grow our own vegetables.  
When I think of Covid 19, I have mixed feelings. Without the pandemic, I would perhaps 
not know what health issues my body is hiding, but on the other hand, the pandemic 
makes my healing quite difficult and challenging. My problems started several months 
before the pandemic - high temperature, fever, but showers and medicine did not help. 
My partner called an ambulance, and I had to stay in the hospital overnight. In the 
morning, as I felt better, they sent me home without any diagnosis. And then a similar 
situation happened almost every month '' me with a fever, hospital, laboratory, back 
home. I remember once, the night after the earthquake (March 22, 2020), I was taken by 
an ambulance to the hospital as my temperature would not go down again. The situation  
was chaotic '' half of the hospital in ruins, people running around. The gynaecologist did 
not have proper gloves and space to perform a regular check -up. But, in the end, they 
helped me reduce my temperature and feel less feverish. However, there was no 
diagnosis again, which was quite logical as they had to deal with the consequences of 
the devastating earthquake. First rumours about some virus could be heard, but I did 
not understand what they were talking about.   
And then the pandemic arrived in its full capacity. When I called my doctor, a general 
practitioner, she told me not to come to her office, as, due to the pandemic, she does 
not admit patients. She also told me to go and get vaccinated. I went to the place  where 
they organized vaccinations in tents. As there were many people there, I walked around 
the courtyard, I spotted on one door sign Roentgenology. I knocked, and asked the guy 
if I could have an X -ray of my lungs. Why I did that, even today I do not kn ow. And, luckily, 
he agreed. He told me that he detected a shadow on my lungs. When I called my general 
practitioner again, she told me that I could have a CT scan in three months. Exhausted, 
without knowing what to do, I finally remembered that my good ac quaintance works at 
one of the hospitals. I called her, and she immediately invited me to come.  She 
organized a CT scan the same day. When she came back with the scans, I knew 
something was very wrong. She told me I have cancer in my abdomen. She immediat ely 
redirected me to a specialist. This oncologist was the best doctor I have ever met. Kind, 
explaining every detail, and full of empathy. Unfortunately, two months ago he moved 
to Denmark as many doctors and nurses had done before him. Finally, I knew th at I have 
 
 
   208 
 
colorectal cancer with metastasis on lungs and liver. I could not open my mouth and 
produce a sound for three full days. Empty, motionless, shocked.  
Then my therapy started. The first time I have received chemotherapy, I stayed three 
days in the hospital. Covid 19 was widespread, and half of the hospital was organized as 
a so-called Covid unit. We have been separated in a small wing, but could hear pat ients 
scream and call for help. The first night, also, two cancer patients I shared the room with, 
died. Today, I don''t know how many chemotherapies were administered into my body, 
and do not know how many more I need to take.   
Transport to and from the hospital is a huge problem. We only have one bus line which 
takes us to the first tram station, and then I need to change to another tram, and then 
again take the bus to the hospital '' at least one and a half hour. And I hardly ha ve the 
energy to survive a ride in a car. There is no organized transport for cancer patients. 
NGO You are not Alone - Ride with us secures transport to and from chemotherapy for 
women, but not for other medical exams. They collect money from private donat ions, 
and not from the state or local government. My partner drives me to the hospital in his 
old car. But, only to the hospital. I often feel like I am a prisoner.  Thanks for offering to 
take me to the pharmacy to collect my diapers - I am entitled to a hundred diapers each 
month through my health coverage - and then we can have a decent coffee. My partner 
cooks, makes sure I take my medicine on time, but I see that he is quite nervous. He 
sometimes shouts for almost no reason. But I am grateful for his s upport. I only feel sad 
sometimes. That''s life, my mother would say. I long to see the sea, I would give anything 
to go to my island of Vis, but I am stuck here. Hope enables me to live through the day. 
And, day by day''maybe one day I will be my old self a gain.","['Healthcare', 'Public Space']",0,"MA degree, fighting cancer, and recently married"
United States,"""I am Jahan, 15 years old, an asylum seeker, now living with my mother and 
younger sister in Croatia. I don''t know how to describe the horror we have lived through 
since fleeing our home and country. I am trying to forget it, but sometimes it is 
impossible  not to shiver.  
I was forced to leave. If I did not go with my mother, I would have had to live with my 
father and that would have been impossible. He is an animal; I don''t know how else to 
describe him. He is religious, very religious. When we started our journey, I thou ght it 
would be easy. We just cross the border and are living in peace. How wrong I was.  But, 
when you are 12, you don''t know much about the world and rules. I learned very quickly. 
When we came to Turkey, I started to understand that it was not going to be a happy 
adventure. We could not go anywhere as we had to throw our documents. Otherwise, 
the Turks would return us to our country. When we crossed the border to Greece, I 
injured my leg. It was an open wound, and it hurt terribly. It did not heal for al most two 
months. Fear was our only companion. We crossed the border in a group, but then 
separated, and continued to walk alone.  We stayed for a few days in some small dirty 
hotels, and then would continue. Only in Bosnia did they catch us once and return  us to 
Montenegro. The second time we succeeded. We found the camp where all the 
refugees were put together. It was a camp of horror. Thousands of refugees, dirty, 
wandering helplessly, hungry and lost. A lot of Afghans were there. We can understand 
their language, but we have not communicated with others often. I was a translator as I 
was the only one who spoke English. Food that was offered to us was horrible. From time 
to time the IMO people were there, and from time to time the Red Cross would bring us 
some food. The pandemic was blossoming. We were not offered vaccination, and many 
people got infected. Luckily, not us. From time to time, we tried to cross the border and 
reach Croatia. People in the camp called this crossing The Game, although it was 
everything but a pastime. Twenty -two times they stopped us and returned us back. 
Police in Croatia looked scary - they were all very tall men, wearing masks, dressed in 
black, with dangerous weapons in their hands. They were brutal. They did not talk to us, 
but just pushed us back to Bosnia. Once one policeman tried to hit me, but my mother 
protected me. They thought I was older. They were only beating males.  
Finally, twenty third time we got lucky. We met a Croatian guy, and he really wanted to 
 
 
   211 
 
help us. He took us to an empty house and told us not to go out, and he started to call 
journalists. He knew it was the only way we may get permission to stay. You saw what it 
looked like on television. We entered a police station, each of us holding a paper on 
which it was written '''I want to get the status of asylum seeker''. It took hours fo r them to 
get instructions, and, in the end, they escorted us to the hotel Porin. Two female 
journalists were following the police car, and waited until the door of the  hotels closed 
behind us. We still communicate with them and became friends. After 10 days of 
quarantine, and then vaccination, we were allowed to go out. We just needed to be back 
before 11 pm. Exhausted, desperate, but we knew that our journey is coming to an end. 
We stayed there seven or eight months, got the status of asylum seekers, and then were 
resettled to the apartment in which we are staying now. My sister and I were tested in 
the nearby school, and now I am a student of the seventh, and she of th e second grade 
of primary school.  On our almost three -year -long journey, we lost a lot of school hours. 
At the Croatian school, we were entitled to 75 hours of language courses, but continued 
to learn it with one NGO. The Croatian teacher comes to school in the morning, but now 
has Covid -19.  I am excellent in maths, physics and English, but the rest remains a 
problem because of the language. We will see how I will pass exams. When we had 
someone infected, we had online education, and it was nothing. I had  a bad Internet 
connection, did not understand much. I prefer being in the class and able to see the 
teachers. I plan to study robotics. I also train volleyball in one club. Luckily, here religious 
education is not mandatory. I am not religious. I was fed up with it in my country. 
Schoolmates are childish, they just want to have fun and play games. But they do not 
discriminate me.  
I miss my language the most, education in my language. We will stay here and hope to 
overcome all obstacles.""","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,"very religious. When we started our journey,"
United States,"""I am Branko, 66, retired, divorced, with a son who is 38 years old, and at the 
moment living in a safe house. We divorced in 2020, at her request, but had to continue 
sharing our small appartement of approximately 40 square meters.  Selling it would not 
enable us to buy two smaller flats. As our son continued to live with us, we even shared 
the same bedroom. I don''t know why, but she started to hate me several years ago. She 
influenced our son, who depends financially on, once our, and now only her support , 
and he stopped communicating with me completely. My son is entirely attached to his 
mother. He does not have any friends and just follows her everywhere. Whatever I tried, 
 
 
      
 
it was useless. She would call me terrible names, humiliate me in front of anyone, show 
how she despises me.  It was obvious that both of them wanted to get rid of me. Several 
months after divorce, I received an official letter that stated I needed to leave the 
appartement in ten days. From the court decision, I learned that she donated our 
appartement to our son without informing me. I could not believe it. At first, we had a 
very small appartement of 27 square meters, and when she started to work in the l ocal 
government office, we changed it for a bigger one. She arranged the papers and 
registered it in her name. I did not mind it as we shared everything, all expenses. In my 
family we were always saying '''our car, our house, our''whatever''. My pension is 300 0 
kuna (400 EUR), but I have two bank loans, 1400 Kn (189 EUR) per month, one for her 
debit card expenses and the second one for some repairs. Immediately, following my 
sister''s advice, I found a lawyer and he filed a complaint and presented papers that 
proved I should be recognised as a co -owner. Last year the court accepted my 
complaint, and decided that the previous transfer must be annulled as I am entitled to 
the half of the property.  Now I am going to insist on selling it, and will demand half of 
the money.   
I am a war veteran, but my firm was shuttered while I was on the battlefield. When I 
returned, I found a job with a private employer '' I am a merchant with a secondary school 
diploma. It meant less money and more work. But I provided food and paid the majo rity 
of bills. I took care of my ill father, and when he died in 2010, I shared the inheritance 
with my sister. I bought new furniture and stuff for the kitchen, and the rest of the money 
'' 5000 EUR I put in a box where I have always left cash. Soon I foun d out that it was gone. 
Both my ex -wife and son denied taking it. I quietly headed towards the door of the room 
realizing that they will not tell me the truth. He pushed me from the back and I fell.  I just 
stood up and left. I did not report it. It was th e first time he attacked me. In 2019, he hit 
me again, and then she called the police, but when they came, they just said that we 
were arguing and the son stood between us. I asked them to forget everything, stupid 
me.  
After the divorce, during 2021, in the midst of the pandemic, the situation became 
horrible. They could not believe that they did not succeed in throwing me out of the 
apartment. I have always been a quiet, non -confrontational person, and they thought I 
would be easy prey.  Sorry for the crying, but I still don''t understand their cruelty. I tried 
to be invisible '' never to be in their way. And I was raised to always think '''what will the 
other people say''. Not smart, but that''s who I am. Soon they started to  turn of the heating 
before leaving for work. I did not protest. But one morning the police arrived. They said 
that my ex -wife came to the police station and reported that I am psychologically 
torturing her.  They soon left. However, it seems that she cont inued reporting violence, 
and one early morning the police came and took me to the station. I called my lawyer as 
I did not understand what was going on. I could not repeat what she said to them '' that 
I am threatening both of them, trying to throw them ou t of the appartement'' The final 
scene occurred in January this year. I was in my room when they came home. She 
shouted at me and demanded to give her back the key for heating. I was in a shock, as 
they were taking it with them to leave me in cold. He immed iately threw me on the floor, 
started hitting me in my kidneys, and shouted I will kill you. He threw me on the bed, 
punched me and my nose started bleeding. Then he started choking me. I thought it 
 
 
   213 
 
was the end. I tried to scream, but nobody could hear me.  Again, the police came. They 
called them. The police took me and put me into jail. Fortunately, in the end, I spoke with 
an intelligent inspector, and he could not believe it when he heard my story. He decided 
to report both of them. I knew that this is the end. They escorted me to th e apartment, I 
packed my life into 5 bags, and found private accommodation. In five days, I spoke with 
the organization that deals with domestic violence, the centre fo r social welfare, and 
finally, after five days was escorted to a safe house. Here I feel safe. And now I need to 
find a new place for living. I will probably go to the town where my sisters lives, and will 
end my days living in peace with the world.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",0,I am going to insist on selling
United States,"""My name is Maja. I am 22, studying social work at the Faculty of Law, third 
year.  I am diagnosed with atypical spinal muscular atrophy, a very rare type which only 
affects a few persons in the whole world.  However, it does not define me as a person. I 
was diagnosed at the age of sixteen, but first signs were visible when I started to learn 
to walk as a small child. As I could still execute many actions, they were not sure what 
disease actually attacked my body. Now I am in a wheelchair , but th at does not prevent 
me from studying and doing hundreds of different things. I am living with my parents 
and a younger brother. He is only five.  
After graduating from the secondary school, I was not sure whether I should study 
psychology or social work, and in the end picked the latter.  I do not regret it. We have 
a lot of practical training education. It starts after the fourth semester. First, I  was in an 
NGO that is focused on child adoption '' they prepare parents who want to adopt a child 
and help them after the adoption is completed. Last year, I was at the Clinical Hospital 
Centre and spent time in the Department of Gerontology learning how t he care of 
elderly should be performed. My grandmother is 84 and staying at a home for the 
elderly, so I know that they need help and special care.  
I have a personal assistant four hours a day. For the last two years decision -makers are 
promising to pass the act on personal assistants, but we are still waiting. They do not 
have regulated status. Predominantly, they are students who are paid per hour. It costs 
less because of the lower taxes. I also have an assistant who stays with me at the faculty 
and helps me during lectures. She is paid by my faculty. I was without an assistant during 
the lockdown, as nobody knew much about the virus and how dangero us it is. During 
that period, I lost track of my studies, but succeeded in catching up later.  
 
 
      
 
Now, I still only attend online lectures, while seminars and exams are organized face -to-
face. They passed regulations that only students with Covid pass or a negative test might 
attend lectures. However, for many students regular testing was too expensive, and the 
faculty arranged for them online education again. Although I am vaccinated, I j oined. 
Especially during winter, it was a horror to sit in a room with all the windows open. 
Freezing. Last winter, I caught a devastating cold. Also, as I need to boo k a transport two 
days in advance, it happened several times that my lectures were cancelled,  and I had 
to wait two hours for my ride back home.  
Now my laptop is my university. I do not like it. I prefer mingling with people, having 
coffee, discussing things, sometimes just gossiping, to sitting in front of a screen alone. 
This is not how studying should look like. I wake up, have a tea, comb my ha ir, and turn 
on the camera. Many don''t listen and just exchange messages. Chat is what prevails. 
Some professors are boring, some make lecturing more interesting. I am different. I like 
to study and enjoy it. However, this way of attending lectures will in fluence the level of 
my knowledge. It is a pity. Sometimes it is funny '' professors forget that we are at home, 
start walking, and we do not hear them anymore. At the moment, I am involved in the 
project that targets students with disabilities. The profess or plans to research 
consequences of the pandemic, especially those related to studying. We have just 
started to discuss it. Even a draft of the research is not finalized.  
I got corona, don''t know anymore which strain of the virus infected me. My brother 
brought it from his kindergarten. At first, it just attacked my nose, which was quite funny, 
but then I had several panic attacks. It was not nice. I would start breathing h eavily, my 
pulse would race, the heart was beating like crazy'' After ten days, everything went back 
to normal. If I was not vaccinated, it might have ended differently.  
I am also volunteering at the Brave Line '' a hot line for children. It helps me feel alive and 
useful. I must be there in person. More and more phone calls are received '' during last 
year, the number of calls has risen 80 percent. Consequences of the pande mic are 
visible. Sometimes they just need someone to talk to, but sometimes I need to call the 
police and direct them to intervene immediately.  Of course, I have a supervisor and she 
or he helps me to decide how to act in a specific situation. I plan to w ork as a child 
psychotherapist in the future. I will enrol to Gestalt psychotherapy education. My 
familiarity with the legislation will help me be even more useful.     
You see, I need to be active. I am an optimist. Of course, sometimes I feel stressed, sad, 
nervous; not because of my disability, but concrete circumstances.","['Education', 'Domestic']",1,Clinical Hospital Centre and spent time
United States,"""I am Ivan, 21 years old, a student at the Faculty of Law. I was born as a girl, 
but since my early childhood knew I was born in a wrong body. I grew up in a small town. 
In our street, there were 10 of us, children playing together. I always wanted to act as a 
male, and as a teenager I found girls attractive, but did not feel as a gay person. Without 
knowing what is wrong with me, or is something wrong, I just dreamt of transforming my 
body into a male one.  I saw an American movie where a person  is changing her sex and 
I started to dream that when I am 18, I will fake my death, and then fly to the USA and be 
what I want '' be a man. It helped me survive. Actually, I was scared. I did not have the 
courage to openly talk to anyone. We were quite poo r, me and my brother were chubby 
and mocked by the other children, and that was already too much for me to handle. 
Telling anyone what bothers me deep inside would make me a victim of cruel bullying. 
I became aggressive '' it was my response to fear and the  lack of self -esteem. These angry 
outbursts usually did not motivate anyone to wonder why I behave like that. But, in the 
sixth grade I collapsed, ran to the toilette, and burst into tears and one girl approached 
me. She was nice. She told me she thought I  was lesbian. I did not tell her the truth but 
felt much better.  
In secondary school, I fell in love with a girl. It was a toxic relationship '' we were 
controlling each other, quarrelling, but then I told her the truth, and she was full of 
understanding. I went to study in Zagreb, we broke up and remained good friends.  
In Zagreb, I contacted an organization that helps LGBT people, participated in the Gay 
Pride. When we had discussions in small groups, I started to introduce myself with a male 
name. It felt good and nobody questioned it.  Finally, an environment where I c ould be 
what I wanted to be.  
After my 19th birthday, I decided to start the transition process. I called my doctor and 
contacted a psychiatric hospital. The meetings with a psychiatrist were ok, but I felt a bit 
uncomfortable when facing a commission that needed to write an opinion wh ich will 
enable me to send a request to the National Council. The regulations are so stupid and 
I had to fight with bureaucracy. If you want to get the final opinion and permission to 
change sex, you need to have an opinion of a psychiatrist, psychologist,  and 
endocrinologist. You should have results that prove you have testosterone in your body, 
but you can''t get hormone therapy without permission. You may become dizzy while 
they run you in circles, but I study law, and am persistent. I waited six months f or the final 
paper. Then, I started my hormone therapy. I had to pay two dozes myself, but then 
realized it should be covered by my health insurance.  I protested, and then they started 
to cover it. I succeeded in changing my documents '' ID, health ID card . Problems at the 
Faculty then began '' how to add previously passed exams to a new person with a new 
opposite sex name.  
I am grateful for the pandemic that started just when the changes were becoming more 
and more visible with each new day. You know, we even have a professor of Family law 
that was telling us how the people who want to change sex are sick and should be taken  
to a psychiatrist. Homophobia is also present among students. The lockdown saved me. 
 
 
   216 
 
I did not have to attend lectures, except online, and was spared of nasty comments. I 
have not felt well in the first phase of the transition. For almost three months I was 
depressed, confused with the changes taking place in my body '' my voice was changing, 
my appearance too. Hormones influenced my emotions too. I did not pass any exams 
and felt lost. I decided to submit an application and ask to freeze my studies and enrol 
to the same semester when ready. After a lot of confusion '' sending papers from one  
office to the other, from administration to professors, then to the dean, aware that now 
all know what I have been going through, they approved it.     
The minute I felt myself again, I started to arrange a mastectomy. An organization that 
supports trans people informed me that I need to go to a private clinic since the hospital 
where it was previously performed had become a Covid -exclusive hospital. At a  private 
clinic, I would have paid almost 3000 euros for such an operation. Where to find one, I 
wondered. Persistent as I am, I found out that other hospitals perform it too, especially 
those where breast cancer is treated. I found one, had the operation,  and my health 
insurance covered it fully. I got rid of my breasts, while simultaneously realizing I will be 
a good lawyer. It is a pity that an organization that claims it represents the rights of trans 
people, does not know such things. I know people who  collected money for operations 
through crowdfunding campaigns. Why?   
Genital transformation is another issue. Nobody performs it in Croatian hospitals. People 
who have money go to Serbia, but I am not so sure when I will have 13.000 euros. Some 
day I will do it, but it has to wait.  
Now I am feeling great. I can focus on my duties at the faculty. We are still online. The 
earthquake demolished our faculty''s building. I hope I will obtain my diploma dressed 
normally and not in my pyjamas. I started to go to the University library with a  colleague, 
just to be out again, dressed normally, and feeling like a normal human being. I also 
started to walk dogs to force myself go out and earn some pocket money.

United States,"""I am Marija, 48 years old, jobless since November 2021, after 30 years of 
work at the same factory. In June 1991, I graduated from a textile vocational school, and 
in September started to work there.  We were well -off at that time '' orders were being 
 
 
      
 
received on a daily basis and all the young women from my school were immediately 
hired.  
However, it did not last for long. The factory was owned by the Croatian Government 
and they did not invest into new machines and did not care for us.  Year after year, less 
and less orders were being received, and less and less workers needed. With outdat ed 
machines, we could not compete in the market. It was also strange that making uniforms 
for the police, army, fire workers was not assigned to our factory, but instead to a one 
privately owned. Then that firm would subcontract us for specific tasks. We s aw all 
around us how oddly the privatization was carried out in our country.   
During the last six years, we were receiving the minimum guaranteed wage. As we are 
situated in a small town, and all the once prosperous industry was dying, we were happy 
to receive anything. The younger women were leaving, but the older did not know wher e 
to go. And we all wanted to work and earn our own money. Stressed and unhappy, I was 
diagnosed with cancer '' both breasts and ovaria. For two years I was on sick leave and, 
when I returned to my factory, the supervisor told me there is no work for me sin ce I 
could not sit at the sewing machine. It was too demanding for my health condition. I was 
devastated, but went to the director and told him what happened. He called the 
supervisor and ordered her to find me a new task. I was sent to the sorting departm ent. 
It was work as hard as sewing. I had to be fully concentrated as I had to pile different 
parts and different sizes of garments separately. If you are not focused, mistakes are 
almost compulsory. I did not make any complaints because I wanted to work.  
Yet, last year, in April, we have not received salaries. Then in May too, then June. We 
were fed up. The government was telling stories of their fantastic measures that saved 
the employment of hundreds of thousands of people, and us, working in a state -own ed 
factory, they just forgot. Their policies ruined our workplace and jobs. For eighteen years 
they kept the same man to manage the factory, did not give a dime to upgrade our 
machines, and now we are left without even the minimal salaries. We organised a 
protest, came to Zagreb, and demanded to talk to someone from the government. The 
minister dared to say that he is not to be blamed for our situation. He claimed in front of 
the media that our shirts were returned by the buyer due to too many errors in sew ing, 
which was not true. He visited us soon after the protest, and promised that we will get 
our salaries soon. When I asked him how come that they can''t find half a million kuna for 
us, while they talk about billions given to other employed people, he jus t turned and 
walked away. Still, it became obvious that the factory is dying. The pandemic took its toll 
too. The work would stop for ten days, then they would invite 7 women to execute some 
tasks, then again a week of forced holidays. Finally, we were inf ormed that the factory 
declared bankruptcy and we were all fired in July. At the employment bureau, we are 
entitled to    euros per month, for six months.  
According to the Labour Law,  they should give us seven salaries as a redundancy 
package. We received only two. Today, our trade union representative held a meeting 
with the county mayor,  and she told him that they would try to donate a one -time 
assistance. Thank you, and shame on you.  
So, what should I do now? I have my diagnosis, who will offer me a job? My husband 
works and it saves us. I am growing vegetables, have hens who are supplying us with 
eggs. My son is still attending primary school, but how we will manage to support him

when he goes to study. I don''t know.  
Sad story. A once prosperous factory with four hundred women employed is now selling 
its machines and furniture. Thank you, my government. The minister was arrested three 
days ago. Should it comfort me?","['Workplace', 'Education']",0,"on sick leave and, when I returned"
United States,"""I am Darya, 35, a woman who escaped violence, probably death, now living 
in Croatia with the status of an asylum seeker, and trying to learn a totally strange 
language. At the moment, I am a happy person as my children and I have a decent 
apartment, we ca n lock the door, cook, talk, rest. After three years of hiding, walking, 
hiking, we are at peace with the world. I hope this will become our permanent home. I 
don''t want to talk about the past. I was forced to marry a man who was aggressive and 
brutal, although I was educated and graduated from the University with a degree in 
business. My only option was to run and leave my country. The children wanted to come 
with me. We travelled through Turkey, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, and were trapped 
in a camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina '' a disgusting place, terrible conditions, with 
thousands of refugees from different countries. All desperate, all wanting to go to 
countries where they can settle and start a new, decent life. The pandemic was 
blossoming, but we escaped infection. As I had to destroy my documents at the very 
beginning of the escape, in order not to be caught and sent back to my country, illegal 
crossing of borders was our only option. A difficult one if I wanted to leave Bosnia, I 
learned s oon. Twenty -two times we climbed hills, wandered through woods, dirty, 
sleepless, desperate, and bumped into policemen with guns who would force us back 
towards the Bosnian camp. No mercy for children, no mercy for me. At one point, my 
daughter, exhausted and terrified, exclaimed:'' Mommy, let''s hold hands and jump from 
this cliff. I can''t walk any longer, I can''t, just can''t walk anymore''.  Today, I do not know 
how we survived, and how I did not lose hope. On our twenty -third attempt, someone 
from the above  felt sorry, and we encountered a man who cared, who wanted to help. 
He would be fined if the police found out that he helped us. He escorted us to an empty 
house, brought us some food, and then started to call journalists. He knew that it was 
our only pos sible protection. We spent two nights hiding there, and then two women 
came with cameramen. They were so nice and friendly. They gave us three papers with 
text: '''we want asylum'' in Croatian, and escorted us to the police station. After that, 
 
 
      
 
everything was chaotic. The police were confused, but cameras were documenting 
everything.  After five hours of sitting there, the police made dozens of phone calls, they 
put us in a police car and took us to Zagreb, to hotel Porin, where refugees are 
accommodated. My son speaks English and he was our interpreter. Both of them had to  
grow up unwillingly. Eight months passed fast. We were sleeping most of the time. Only 
then did we realize how tired we were. After eight months, we received confirmation of 
our asylum status and were transferred to an apartment. As our story was all over the 
media, and the public expressed empathy, authorities did not dare to reject us and send 
us back to Bosnia. They will cover the rent for two years, and we receive 1500 kuna (200 
EUR) per month, but I am looking for a job. Food is expensive here. I started smoking in 
Bosnia. Everyone smokes there and I was so stressed that I needed comfort. It''s not 
smart, but my life is not a fairy tale. Tomorrow I will go to a cake factory a nd see if they 
will employ me. I want my children to have a decent life. If I start working there, my salary 
will be 4000 kuna plus 500 for transport.   
I do not have any connection with my family, and nobody we know is living in Europe. It 
is only the three of us. I have to be strong for them. They do not have anyone but me.  
I am learning Croatian, but need to learn English too. One NGO is organizing language 
lessons for free on its premises, and the other one arranged private lessons for me three 
times per week. The government is not providing language lessons for adults. My 
teacher comes to our flat. We became friends. One of the journalists is also helping us 
all the time. We have become like sisters.  
I would like to become a tram driver as they have decent salaries. But the exam is very 
expensive,  and I need to be fluent in Croatian.  
In the far future, I plan to be an activist and fight for women''s rights.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,forced to marry a man who was
United States,"""I am Mario, 26, student at the Academy of Dramatic Arts, who decided to 
pause studying in order to find a job, and be capable of taking a loan at the bank and 
buying an apartment. For me, with my very hectic and chaotic childhood, to have a home 
is one of  the most important things. The prospect of paying for it for another thirty years 
is not as intimidating as renting and moving from one place to the other. Both my parents 
died, my father a long time ago, and my grandmother lives in an apartment that is g oing 
to be returned to the owners who lost it during the nationalization in  5. I am in love, 
which makes me happy, of course. And I successfully got rid of my breasts, took hormone 
 
 
     
 
therapies, and from the outside look like a genuine guy. Inside, I felt that way almost 
since I was born, although I did not know how to name it and what to do about it. I do 
not plan to undergo genital transformation. I am happy as I am today and I do not have 
the money for such an extremely expensive surgical intervention. I am tall, go to the gym 
regularly, hormones support beard growth, and nobody can even think that, once upon 
a time, I was a girl. From the outside. I also pay for a private gynaecologi st as I can''t 
imagine the reaction of a doctor whose exams are paid by the health insurance and, 
even more so, of the women sitting in the waiting room.   
I have not changed my documents because I am a bit lazy, but also because I know how 
much of a pain in the ass such a procedure is. I heard that during the pandemic it may 
last for up to twelve months. Still, I have to do it. It is complicated if I go to a ny institution 
where an ID is mandatory '' it takes me half an hour to explain. I decided to have a 
mastectomy during the pandemic, as people were predominantly staying at home, I 
could work from my room and recover peacefully. However, the hospital that sp ecializes 
in performing this sort of operations was transformed into a Covid centre and I had to 
pay a lot of money to a private clinic. I organized a crowdfunding campaign and raised 
the whole sum. I study at such a faculty that I know a lot about dramatu rgy, directing, all 
the staff you need for creating an interesting campaign. And my friends helped me too.    
I did not have any problems at my faculty, no harassment occurred. They are more open 
minded, significantly more than an average Croatian citizen. Though, there, handsome 
girls have problems with sexism and inappropriate behaviour of male professors. You 
must have heard about it. Our female dean decided to act and I hope that the situation 
is going to change for the better. It was at the faculty, between my colleagues and some 
professors, that I started to introduce myself as male before the transition. Wha t was 
unexpected, when I finally told my closest relatives, was the positive reaction of my ultra -
conservative granny and my macho brother. It seems that love overpowered prejudice 
and homophobia. My brother would even bring his gang if anybody dared to be  rude 
towards me.  And I am not sheepish myself.  
The decision to take a break in my studies was also motivated by the conditions of 
studying during the pandemic. It you have an online lecture on body movement, it is 
really strange and even grotesque. It is very different than at many other faculties. For  
us, group work is vital. Now I resumed my studies and in February will, hopefully, get my 
MA diploma.  
As I am working for an NGO, I know how difficult, and opposite to my situation, can this 
trans condition be. Especially for people living in small settlements. They do not know 
who to talk to, what to do, how to start and where. It is much easier if you li ve in Zagreb. 
Everything is happening here. If you succeed in finding a friendly psychiatrist, 
psychologist and endocrinologist, the final approvement, which opens a path towards a 
change of documents, must be executed in Zagreb. Now we have the organizati on Trans 
Aid that gives advice and tries to help the people who do not know whom to turn to for 
help. Things are changing. Slowly, alas.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",1,I know how much of a pain
United States,"""I am Greta, 60 years old nurse, divorced long time ago, with two adult sons, 
working with a general practitioner in one village. We have 700 patients, some living 
alone in remote areas, predominantly older population, but also with several young 
families engaged in agriculture.  Most of the time I am alone, as my doctor spends only 
30 per cent of her working hours with me in the infirmary.   There were periods when I 
was left alone, without any doctor. Rarely anyone wants to work in this part of Croatia, 
famous for its poverty and depopulation. I have also patients from other towns, Zagreb, 
villages.  
The pandemic ruined health care system, and consequences are to be witnessed in the 
near future. Diagnostic procedures were halted, treatments were postponed, and many 
doctors and nurses left Croatia in a quest for better work conditions and salaries. I lo ve 
these people here, I love to live here, and plan to retire here.  But I have always been a 
bit crazy. I know I am sixty, but my energy deserves hardly 30 years of age.  However, I 
feel pity when I see people standing in the rain, and waiting to be let t o a doctor. Majority 
even rejects to see patients in person, but communicate via phone or email. Nurses who 
 
 
     
 
have  0 patients are half crazy '' they are overloaded with work. They need to answer 
phones, respond to messages, talk to patients in person, and then cover all 
administration demands.  
And we had hundreds of earthquakes that accompanied the pandemic. I was in the 
infirmary when the strongest one hit us. I ran out, and then saw how the roof and half of 
the building crushed. To tell the truth, it looked horrible before the earthquake. Now I 
am working in the container given by the private donor. And I had to find him, and 
arrange everything. It was not done by the local or national government. If we waited on 
them, we would be camping in a tent today.   Its chaotic and bureaucratic to the b one. 
Even with our donation we had problems '' papers for deconstruction of the ruined 
building, papers for the container, papers for electricity, papers for water pipes''It went 
slow, and then I called a doctor who is member of the ruling party, and then th ings went 
smoothly. That''s how things are done.  
I work extra hours, actually, never look at my watch. I see how people are devastated '' 
the pandemic and earthquakes are too much for too many. Left without homes, living in 
fear, they need support continuously. Very often I work 10 to 12 hours per day. I also 
started to volunteer, and help people in need with finding temporary homes, writing 
requests, collecting documents. I have a car and very often give them a ride wherever 
they need to go. On one hand, I help others, but also help myself. I do not have time to 
think, to be depressed, to stop functioning.   
What makes me sad is seeing old people left alone. Their children are living abroad, and 
do not care about their parents. Before the earthquake, I was responsible for one home 
for elderly people. As their building was hit hard, they were resettled.  I thin k the 
Government should do something about it. The Family law prescribed that child is 
obliged to take care of its parents if they do not have enough financial resources.  
My salary is not worth mentioning if I count my working hours and distances I have to 
cover '' it goes up to 900 euro due to my experience and home visits I execute. If I were 
young, starting to work, without any extra hours and travel, my salary would be 6 50 euro.

United States,"I'm Aliz, a 23 -year -old girl from Budapest who achieved my BA from 
sociology at Warwick University in 2021. I've been living in Budapest again since last 
spring, but I arrived in London a few days ago because I want to work here until I get 
accepted for an  MA program. I was a second year Sociology BA student in England when 
the Covid  caused the first closures, and the university went online. It came at a bad time 
because I was about to start looking for an internship for my future career, which was 
complete ly cancelled because of Covid , and I felt that it would affect the rest of my life. 
It didn't affect us as a family because nobody got sick from it, but it was shocking when 
we had to come home with my sister, who also attends the university in England, because 
of the closures and our  parents were very scared and even afraid of us. We were 
quarantined in our own flat by our dad, who took control on the grounds of an 
emergency, even though we had been independent for years, but now he was 
controlling who we could see and how. This caused so much tension that my sister and 
I moved to another flat for a week, and then we moved back home with new living 
arrangements. But after that our family life became very peaceful. I had no classes by the 
time the university  came online, but I had a lot of essays piled up, for which we were 
given a month's grace period. Covid  also completely rewrote my summer plans, I had 
just applied to Berkley for a summer program, to Vienna for an internship, these were 
hard to process how  this was going to affect my career, that they were cancelled, but 
also the university was hard to understand how it was going to work. But for me there 
was also a more general anxiety about how this whole pandemic was going to change 
the world, either soc ially or economically, but at the same time it was good to see the 
rainforests recovering. All the while, it was a weird movie experience of personally 
experiencing a global historical event. At the beginning I almost enjoyed not having to 
leave the house after the huge social life, the exam period kept me very busy anyway, 
plus I started to keep in touch online with several friends I had hardly seen in person 
recently. By the summer it was bad that everything was cancelled, we didn't go on 
holiday with the  family, everything I had planned was cancelled. The most painful thing 
was that I got myself into something and then it didn't work out. The university was also 
unsure whether it would start, but I ended up taking two classes offline in the fall of 2020. 
Financially, I was doing well because I was at home in Budapest while getting 80% of my 
English salary as a furlough since I was also working in a cafe there. That's a lot of money 
in Hungary. My first year at university was spent to integrate into this ne w life, in the 
second year I started working in the cafe, in the third year I finally started my social life 
and it was really bad that covid interrupted it and I couldn't go out partying. I came home 
to Budapest at the end of the third year, because the u niversity was closed and I was 
supposed to apply for MA programs, but I was not able to do it. Because of the covid, it 
was also hard to apply for good internship, because the last year''s graduates applied for 
 
 
   225 
 
the same places as this year''s graduates. But in the meantime, I realised that I didn't want 
to apply for graduate jobs, I was just under so much pressure that that''s the only way I 
also must pursue. In hindsight, it was difficult to move back home to my parents because 
of Covid , because the calm environment, the care of my parents, the fact that my dad 
even read my exam essays, made me forget what I was capable of. But I feel like it would 
have been much worse if I had to graduate from the high school unde r the covid. I really 
missed the parties at university then, and now that I'm out of university I don't miss it 
either and I've become closer with my friends in quarantine.","['Workplace', 'Education']",0,"life, in the second year I started"
United States,"""I'm Tibi, 25 years old, a single homosexual boy, now in my second year at 
the Faculty of Law in Budapest.  
I've been openly gay since I was 16, but fortunately I went to an open and tolerant private 
high school and it was no problem at all that I am gay. I was maybe 13 -14 years old when 
I felt that I am gay, but it took me a year or two to come out with my iden tity. I didn't even 
have to tell my parents, because they were the ones who asked me nicely if I am gay, 
and I told them yes. Since then I've become more comfortable talking about it. I 
remember the first time I told someone that I am gay, he was a complet e stranger on 
Instagram whom I started corresponding with, but at that time I was still nervous for a 
couple of months about how I was going to come out with it.  In Budapest, especially in 
the countryside, it's very difficult to form a serious homosexual relationship, because 
many people still keep it secret. Sometimes it's the third meeting that they find out that 
they are still being kept up by a straight family. I think that  gay people are mostly afraid 
of their families and their workplaces, of what they will say, and that's why most of us 
 
 
     
 
don't dare to enter into a serious relationship, because it would be spectacular and 
coming out is very difficult for us. For me, I don't have a long -term relationship because 
I don't have the time, I'm studying at the university and I'm working at the same time.  My 
best friends organise gay parties where I go from time to time and where I have chance 
to meet other gay people. On a personal level, the homophobic LGBTQ law that was 
passed during the covid emergency has not changed anything for me. In fact it  has 
backfired and the situation has improved because it has thematised the issue in public 
discourse and has galvanised so many people that people are more accepting now than 
they were 5 years ago and I feel that more and more people are coming out. This has 
also been helped a lot by the TikTok , where everyone is more openly daring to admit 
that they are gay.  
I spent a semester in Brussels on Erasmus, and the atmosphere there was very different 
from home, it's much easier to be gay there. If there was a serious connection, I might 
stay. I have a very good micro -environment here at home, I've never had a serious  
problem with it, so it never occurred to me to move out of the country. But many gay 
people are thinking about going abroad, but everyone comes up to Budapest because 
it is very difficult to be gay in the countryside.  
 
I always wanted to work in a bigger company or a multinational company because they 
are more accepting than a small Hungarian company. That's why I never applied for a 
job there. Becoming an activist is a matter of habitus, most people, as long as it doesn 't 
affect them personally, don't care, but the paedophile law that was brought together 
with LGBTQ people, it really pissed off a lot of people and a lot of people stood up 
against the law and for LGBTQ people. I used to go to Pride, but I'm not into anyth ing 
else, and the law is just a bully. I would like to have a child later, that would be better 
with a couple, but I might go it alone, maybe a biological child, but I'm fine with 
adoption, at least then I'm helping a child. If they make that impossible at  home by law, 
I would move abroad for that reason.

were deported from Oradea, first to Ret, and from there my father applied for this railw ay 
job in Revfülöp. I finished my school in Revfülöp. I finished the 8 year long primary 
school, and my parents wouldn't let me finish secondary vocational school and I had to 
go to work in the horticulture when I was 16. That's where I met my husband, who m I 
married when I was 18. They didn't want me to marry him because then the money I 
earned from the job would not have gone to them. When I got married, my mother -in-
law gave us a room in their house so we could save the money we earned from work for 
a year. Later we got an apartment from the Producers' Cooperative, and I still live in that 
house today. Water was not piped into the house, we had a bathroom by the time my 
eldest daughter was born in 1960. After that I had two more daughters born in 64 and 
69. I stayed at home with the children, worked at home as a housewife, because there 
was no child support then. We both worked all the time, and later we planted vineyards. 
We were always happy to do everything, we were always getting richer, we kept 
expand ing our house, and eventually everyone had their own room. We always got 
better and better and I never felt tired. I worked in a restaurant in a village on Lake

nearby and came to our house many times, my middle daughter even left the children 
here for 2 months when they worked abroad. My youngest daughter took care of them 
a lot, and I cooked and baked for them. My husband died 7 years ago; it is still very 
difficult to get used to being alone. My children help me a lot, they call and come all the 
time. When the covid came, I was scared at first that I would be alone in the house, but I 
followed everything they told me, but my days ended up like normal. My family also 
 
 
     
 
came during the covid, but I saw them less often and we were still out in the yard. But I 
still cooked and baked the same way, I even cooked for myself all the time.  
I could only contact the doctor by phone as there was no medical check -up because of 
the covid. But I was not afraid that there would be no food in the shops, there was no 
shopping frenzy like in the cities.  
But I missed the pensioners' club, which hasn't been reopened since, and the 
neighbours didn't come over, but I kept in touch with everyone by phone. I got 
vaccinated, that was not an issue, but there are many people who didn't get vaccinated

of living together, he didn't come back after a week which hit me really hard I felt I 
 
 
     
 
needed to behave even better and I begged my husband to come back. This was 
followed by a year and a half of living hell, which has included a lot of physical abuse, 
choking and punching in the stomach, and street fights. By this time, I had also seen a 
psychologist but he was not good enough. I felt that my life is not normal, bu t I couldn't 
articulate that I was living in an abusive relationship. My sister and one of my husband''s 
friends were the only people who knew about the abuse, but both of them only  knew of 
one incident. My sister was firm, she said one more time and she would take action, but 
my husband's friend said it was really bad, but '''we know how you can be, I would slap 
you too''.  
We broke up after a year and a half, but after three months he started calling me again. 
We got married in 2010, we went to couples therapy in 2011, but after a year and a half 
the therapists found out about the abuse. We originally left on the grounds tha t we had 
a conflictual relationship, our arguments went too far, and that I was putting him down 
verbally. Then the therapists started to suspect that there was abuse. Then they stopped 
the therapy so we couldn't continue because it's not ethical to have t herapy in an abusive 
relationship. I was sent to individual therapy, but I didn't want to start again and I couldn't 
identify myself with the victim role. Then things got out of hand again at home, but we 
had a child by then, so I called one of the therapi sts from couples therapy and said I 
couldn't handle it at home anymore, and then I started seeing one of them individually. 
After six months I moved out with my son and went home to my mother. After that, my 
husband didn't give me any money, but he came to  see the child.  
Less than a month later, he started threatening me that I had kidnapped the child and 
that he was going to prosecute me for child endangerment. I had no money for a lawyer, 
so I turned to legal aid services for help. Eventually, we went to a mediator to ag ree on 
the details of the divorce, and that's what we finally filed and within a year we were 
divorced.  
We don't really cooperate in relation to our son, I don't know exactly where he takes the 
child on the weekends when he is with him. Now there is zero communication between 
us, but at least there is no fighting. In the first 2 -3 years after the divorce, th ere was 
regular arguing, my dad had to be called over because he didn't want to leave the 
apartment. Even today, my son is anxious to tell me about his time with his father, 
because his father tells him things like don't tell me this and don't tell me that . He doesn't 
really like to go to his father's house because he doesn't like to sleep there. He also does 
not like to go for a long summer holiday with him, afterward, he has all sorts of 
psychosomatic or anxiety symptoms.",['Domestic'],3,I felt I needed to behave even
Hungary,"""I am Erzsi, a 36 -year -old Roma woman from a village, I escaped from an 
abusive relationship 7 years ago. I have one daughter, she is 17 years old.  
I grew up in a small village in East Hungary and I have three brothers and sisters. My 
parents have been day labourers all their lives, now they work as public workers. Today, 
I run an association in my village, which I set up under the first lockdown when  I was 
forced to return home because of the closures. I have two brothers working in the 
association, which deals with housing, health, education and employment of local Roma. 
My association also deals with environmental pollution, because we Roma, because  of 
our poverty, live in a very polluting way, for example, we burn everything to keep the 
house warm, but this releases a lot of toxic substances into the air.  
Two of my brothers and sisters have a school leaving certificate, and I am now applying 
to university, one brother and sister have a vocational school certificate, and one has 
eight primary school degrees.  
My parents wouldn't let me study, but I went to a secondary vocational school to study 
health studies. My parents did not want me to study, they said a woman does not need 
education, so I hid from my parents and i could prepare for classes. I was bullied a  lot by 
my parents when I was in the primary school because I wanted to study. I raised my 
brothers and sisters, because my parents worked all the time, coming home late at night 
from the work. We were not raised by our parents, we didn't even know them, m y 
younger sister calls me her mother. Now that's completely changed, I support them and 
now they are very proud of me working for a famous foundation in Budapest, and I think 
they also feel guilty that they didn't support me. My life is fucked up now, it w as ruined 
by the expectation that they wouldn't let me do what I wanted to do. If they then support 
 
 
     
 
me in talking to a boy without having to marry him straight away, my life won't turn so 
tragic. In our culture, if a girl goes out for the evening, it means she is already a woman 
and is forced to marry the boy she has met. Even though I could prove that nothing had 
happened, and I hadn't lost my virginity, I was forced to marry a boy I liked  when I was 
16. I was forbidden to meet him for a year, from the age of 15, because they did not want 
me to marry an Vlah Gypsy boy, but wanted a Romungro husband. At 1 6, when I had to 
move to my father -in-law's house, I was not allowed to go to school. My parents wouldn't 
let me go home, and in the new house I had to cook, do the washing and cleaning, and 
I couldn't go anywhere.  
I got my first slap from my husband after two weeks we had been together. In that family, 
aggression was commonplace, my husband's sister was in an abusive relationship too. 
We never had that at home. I remember every moment of the abuse over the years, I felt 
so ostracised, I learned to keep quiet, and it led to depression. It never occurred to me 
to seek professional help, a Gypsy woman in the countryside has no one to turn to. I was 
also treated badly because I didn't get pregnant straight away, even tho ugh we tried, 
and I gave birth to Jasmin when I was already 19. My life was hell after that, even in front 
of Jasmin, I was constantly beaten. After a long time, I found out that there was another 
woman, but to this day I don't know if she had a child with  that woman. I didn't want to 
find out because I was always running away from the knowledge so that it wouldn't hurt 
so much. When things got really bad, I would go home with my little girl to my parents, 
but I would always go back to him because he begged  me to go back and I loved him 
very much and my daughter also loved is her father.  
After a while they let me work because they needed the money I earned from my work. 
My husband had a bad temper, he was aggressive, so the other Roma who had work, 
they didn't take him with them. One New Year's Eve, when I came home, my husband 
wanted to h ave sex with me, but I didn't want to, so he tried to strangle me with a string. 
I could feel death coming, I was about to let go of my life, but then he looked me in my 
eyes and let me go. Then I went out into the cold night without a bag, without a coat,  
leaving my child behind. I asked my sister -in-law to help me bring the child, but she 
couldn't manage. After one night I went home to my mother. Jasmine was 10 years old 
at the time, but I never got my daughter back who stayed with her father. I wasn't al lowed 
to see her, I was on the verge of death for six months, I wanted to die and I couldn't see 
my daughter, but I couldn't have done it.  
In the meantime, I met my current partner, who is a gift from God, and finally after six 
months I was able to see my daughter again. My daughter is 17 now, she is still with her 
father, although legally I have the child, but she would go crazy if she had t o be 
separated from her father, because that is how she was brought up. I live in Budapest 
now, but she can't come to see me, I have travel to the countryside to see her. I see him 
every three weeks or so. I can't have another child for medical reasons.","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,"life is fucked up now, it w"
United States,"""My name is Anna, and I am from another European country. I came to Dublin 
in the summer of 2019 to do my Masters in Arts. Before that I lived in another European 
country where I did my undergrad course, and I also worked in Southern Europe before 
that. I now live in Dublin and work for a non -profit organization.  
I moved to Dublin in summer 2019 so I was fortunate that when the pandemic hit Ireland 
around St Patrick''s Day, I was already done with most of my courses. I ''only'' had to write 
my thesis and do the job placement. At that time '''the university was pretty sh it in terms 
of supporting students throughout the pandemic. At least in our course we didn''t hear 
anything from them''. And for our thesis, they just added a sentence there saying ''just let 
us know how Covid  affected you in ways that had an impact on your t hesis''. But obviously 
Covid  affected all of us, because most of us were international students and most of us 
were from outside of Europe. '''So, obviously the mental health toll was a bigger toll than 
the practical toll, such as not being able to access libraries. Because we were obv iously 
all stuck in here, we didn''t know what to do. We didn''t know if it would be better to go 
home, or to stay in Ireland''. So I think that in terms of support the university was not a 
very helpful place. But for me the writing  of the thesis and having that kind of focus was 
helpful in terms of keeping me sane.  
I had to do a job placement before I wrote the thesis and this was part of the course. I 
think for a lot of us it was the part that we all look forward the most. It was the last thing 
after all our courses were finished, so it took place from April to May.  The placement 
turned into an online thing, but I was lucky that I still got it. A lot of people that I studied 
with wouldn''t have that chance as some arts organisations were amongst those most 
affected by the pandemic and didn''t have a capacity for an int ern. I did mine with an arts 
company, but '''it was obviously such a different experience from what I initially thought 
it would be. And it kind of sucked''. I know that if I had done it in person, I would have 
gone to the place and meet all the people. '''So t he people were actually lovely there, 
but it was the work that changed so much. And it was obviously outside their control 
because they had different plans, but it just was not what any of us was expecting. And I 
didn''t really get as much out of it as I ho ped, except that I was able to put on my cv that 
I have done the placement''.  
'''During that time, especially at the beginning, I had a terrible Zoom anxiety. To the point 
that I had to leave zooms my friends, because my heart would just start beating like crazy, 
and I would get so anxious that I had to say: ''I actually cannot do this ''''. And I tried to use 
Zoom, while I was doing the placement. One of the first meetings was on Zoom, and 
everyone had their camera on, because it was a small team and they all knew each other. 
And in Zoom '''you always have to present, even though you are no t doing anything''. 
They were talking about things that didn''t really affect me, so I asked if I could skip the 
 
 
     
 
next Zoom. And I was not really met with any understanding. '''But I didn''t have the words 
to say ''I get incredibly anxious, I am not getting anything out of those zooms, just write 
me an email and tell me what you want. Because I don''t even know you''. So, it was very 
stressful''.  
In terms of writing the thesis, in normal times, we would use the library a lot more. And 
for the first part '' '''obviously the campus was closed, and we were not allowed in, so we 
had to write at home. I was fortunate that we lived in a big enough house, so  it wasn''t 
the worst''. One of the people I studied with actually went to a train station to write, just 
because there was no space for her at home. '''And some people lived in a one -bedroom 
apartment, or just had a tiny room without a desk. I didn''t have a d esk in my room, so I 
was just writing in the kitchen all the time''.  
'''Obviously it was different for everyone, and I don''t want to speak for everyone in my 
course, but just being away from home, and also being in your early, mid or late 20s, 
when everyone tells you: ''those are your best years!'' and then you are stuck at hom e''. 
And you need to find the way to not just write your thesis, but also find some other outlets 
'' but then there is nothing to do. And I have done all the walks, and I played so much 
guitar, but I would have preferred to go out and meet more people.  
After all that I got a job in a Non -Profit organization in Dublin, through a friend from the 
course. It was part -time at the beginning but then it changed to full -time. We have always 
been considered essential services because we do community support. So we were 
always going to the office and doing the hybrid work. So '''we were always able to go to 
the office, which was a God sent. I am very fortunate in that sense that I get to go in and 
actually interact with n ice people''.","['Workplace', 'Education']",1,I am not getting anything out of
Spain,"""My name is Emilia, I am 26 years old, and I moved to Ireland in summer of 
2019 to do a Master''s course in one of the universities in Dublin. I left my home country 
eight years ago. Before coming to Dublin, I worked in a hotel in Spain, and then I moved 
to another country in Europe to do my undergraduate degree.  
I was fortunate in a sense that when the pandemic really kicked off in Ireland, I was 
already done with most of my courses. '''I was also very lucky that I lived in a house with 
 
 
     
 
four other people back then '' three of them were Americans and one of them was Irish. 
Having that support network was incredibly important to me during that time. And I 
noticed that when we were all very much stuck at home, the people you live with are very 
important''. It can be very difficult in Dublin because housing is so expensive '''that  you 
kind of end up in weird housing situations sometimes''. And I was lucky that we lived in 
a big house in a nice South Dublin neighbourhood, which has a very suburban f eeling, 
and we had a garden.  
Not everything was easy though: '''I feel like everyone was kind of just struggling in the 
house as well. And then you wanted to support each other but you didn''t always have 
the capacity to do so. So that was tricky to navigate. But I think we all really ap preciated 
each other''s company, because we all knew '' and we talked about it at great length '' 
that this was very special to have''.  
I am a very high achiever, I always had very good grades, and I put a lot of pressure on 
myself to do that. But '''towards the last week before I handed in my master''s thesis, I had 
a sort of epiphany where I felt that it doesn''t really matter if I get A or B or C or whatever, 
as long as I pass. And that was a very liberating experience''. But at the same time, I was 
under so much pressure during Covid . Even when things opened during the summer of 
2020, before I handed in my thesis '' I remember the night or th e day before I handed it 
in - '''I just started sobbing in the garden, I was just sitting there, and then had to wake up 
the next day feeling like absolute shit, and finish writing up the thesis''. And then the 
winter of 2021 '' pretty much around the same tim e last year '' was particularly hard 
'''because we thought that ''after the summer everything will be better''. And then it just 
got worse, and we were all stuck at home''. At that time, I made the decision to stay in 
Ireland because I got a job, and I was lucky  to get a job even remotely related to what I 
studied. But at the beginning the job was part -time, it was winter, and everything was 
closed. '''I would say it was my lowest during the pandemic, that winter at the end of 2020 
and the beginning of 2021. Just i n terms of feeling very isolated. I had very few friends 
here, a lot of people who I would have gotten close from course had left the country, 
and you don''t want to have only one person to rely on, because the other person is also 
obviously struggling''.  
'''I also started therapy then, which really helped to just have somewhere to go to and 
talk free, or just word vomit for an hour a week''. But I didn''t have a lot of money because 
I was on a part time contract, and there were mental health support services f or people 
on low income. There was also the Jigsaw for those under 25, but '''the waiting list was 4 
months, and I said: ''I need to speak to someone now!!!'', so I went with a different 
organisation''. But in terms of comparing it '' because I had done therapy when I was an 
undergrad, and I paid the full price '' I could really see the difference. '''Because when 
you are on ''low income'' services, you get paired with a trainee. And I could really tell that 
this person was not qualified in the sense that I was used t o during my previous therapy''. 
But it was fine for what I needed, '''because I just needed to talk to somebody, I didn''t 
need a long -term support, I just needed an immediate support''.  
And then things got much better, during last summer. I still have ups and downs, but I 
got much better. I listen to myself and my needs, and I am minding myself. And maybe, 
I suppose, going back to Covid  for me ties also with the queerness itself. '''For me it was 
kind of coming to terms with my gender identity as well. Because I recently started to 
 
 
     
 
identify as non -binary as well. And that was a big step for me because I think I have a lot 
of ''internalised homophobia''. So it has been also a very positive year for me in terms of 
growth. And it is something that I probably wouldn''t have done as quickly as I did if I 
haven''t so much time to reflect on myself''.""","['Workplace', 'Identity']",1,"I worked in a hotel in Spain,"
United States,"""My name is Magda, and I am from Poland. I came to Ireland 17.5 years ago. 
At the moment I am unemployed. I was made redundant last year, and I decided to take 
a break, after working in Ireland for almost 18 years. I started college and I study data 
analyt ics full -time. I also started to look for a new job as college is supposed to finish in 
May. I worked for a year and four months under Covid . Covid  started in March, and I was 
let go in June the following year.  
When the pandemic hit, I was still working in an investment bank. The change to work 
from home was very hard for me because '''when you work in the office, and then you all 
the sudden work remotely, and you are at home with a kid, it was hard to get the work 
done. And at work in general, it w as a disaster, because nobody was prepared for the 
remote work. So people didn''t know what to do''. We also had a problem with vendors 
in India, because they were all getting sick and most of them lived away from their 
families, and they were stuck in the s mall rooms they were renting. The restrictions were 
very hard over there so these people were very depressed, and it reflected on their work. 
And it also reflected on our work. We had loads of work at that time.  
'''Besides that I missed people from work. Because when things went bad between myself 
and my ex -partner, I always had people from work, who were very funny, cheerful'' In 
fact I spent entire day with them''. And that had stopped. So for me that was extremely 
hard, to get used to work from home, and not seeing these people.  
Before Covid  started, we used to work from home for one day a week, because the 
management agreed that we could do that. But it was different. They were saying, maybe 
not openly, but it was generally known that ''ah, well, there is no harm if somebody puts 
 
 
     
 
the wash on or makes dinner''. So it was known that that day, when you are not in the 
office, you don''t do much work. You just have to have the laptop on, but you are 
probably using it to watch Netflix. '''And when Covid  started, problems started''. You had 
to have two monitors, and they gave us no equipment. People had to buy everything 
themselves. They sent me one monitor later, but you had to have two monitors, and you 
had to have a workstation. And they assumed that ev eryone had a PC at home. '''Because 
it wa s no longer that you sit with the laptop on your lap. You HAD TO WORK, and that 
was the worst of all of that. Before that the remote work was a bit of a joke, you would 
turn on your laptop, somebody would said something every now and then, but it was 
gener ally known that you are not in the office and you are not getting much work done''.  
I also didn''t have any appropriate clothes to wear at home because I only had dresses 
for work. And we were laughing with the girls at work that one day a week of remote 
work is OK, but more days working from home is not great. There was this snow blaze in  
Ireland two or three years ago, and our bank was closed for a week, and the girls were 
saying that at that time they didn''t even wash themselves for two or three days. '''And it 
was like that in the beginning of Covid . I was sitting in my pyjamas, I stopped  brushing 
my hair and I stopped putting my make up on. In the beginning I maybe washed myself 
every second day because I was not going anywhere''. It was only later that I had to work 
on it and to say to myself that it doesn''t matter whether I sit in my pyj amas or in old track 
suit bottoms, I still must wash myself anyway. '''And a lot of people in the office said that 
it was the same for them, that because they were not going to the office, they didn''t have 
to put the make up on, or brush their hair''. In some  teams they had to turn on their 
cameras every day, just to encourage people to get dressed and to wash themselves. 
This also started to be practiced in my team after a while, but we only had to do it once 
a week. '''So then you had to put your make up and b rush your hair '' but only on 
Thursdays''.  
The fact that I was made redundant was not related to Covid . I just didn''t get on with my 
manager who didn''t even speak to me. Because he treated me badly, I threated that I 
would complain to the HR about the unfair treatment. The manager and the head of my 
department got scared. And I always wanted to get the red undancy and I was saying it 
to everyone. So they offered me the redundancy. But there was no Covid  related

Poland,"""My name is Karolina, I live in Dublin, and I am from Poland. I am 43 years 
old. I am a single mum, and my son is 8 years old. I am currently unemployed, but I 
worked full -time in a bank for a year and four months during Covid , while I was also 
studying part -time.  
 
I had a quite difficult situation when the pandemic started because at that time I was 
splitting up with my partner, the father of my son. He moved out in October 2019, and I 
had to look for a new house. I was meant to buy the house from my parents -in-law, but 
they changed their mind, so I had three months between December 2019 and March 
2020 to find a new house. After that my contract was going to be finished. And 
fortunately, because of Covid , things got delayed and I was able to buy the house I have 
now.  This is the first aspect of Covid , the fact that the sale was delayed, and I got the 
house.  
 
'''The problem was that my in -laws were helping me to look after my son. And we couldn''t 
really meet with other people because we didn''t want to infect them''. In the beginning 
everybody was scared. '''For me Covid  had a psychological impact, it really brought me 
down, the fact that I had to stay and home and that I couldn''t see other people. Because 
it wasn''t even about me that I couldn''t meet people''. It would have been different if I 
could go out and not be worri ed, and '''I couldn''t because I was worried that I would get 
infected and then they would get infected. Maybe other people don''t remember it that 
bad, but for me it was a very bad time''. So for the first six weeks of Covid  I had not seen 
anybody except my father -in-law and the father of my son.   
 
I also managed very badly with home schooling. At that time, I worked full -time remotely, 
and I was also studying part -time. '''I remember that we were crying together'' with my 
son, because I was meant to finish an assignment and to record the description of  codes, 
and my son was constantly talking, so I couldn''t record the description. '''I didn''t have the 
energy to start it all over again and he got very upset and started crying, and I started 
crying as well''. I also remember that I felt so bad for not having  time for him. He got 4000 
Lego blocks for his birthday, it was a ship, and I was so exhausted, and I had an 
assignment due next day, but I was up with him until 3am putting these blocks together. 
'''Because I felt so bad about the fact that I never had time  for him, and that there was 
always something else I had to do''. I felt that I wasn''t giving him enough time, because 
he was staying at home with me, and I was constantly on my laptop. While we still lived 
in the old neighbourhood, we were going out during  my lunch break, and he was riding 
his bike. '''That was all I could give him timewise, during the day, that one hour during 
 
 
     
 
lunch''. But the second positive of Covid  is that '''my son learned how to speak Polish. 
Because he didn''t speak Polish before the pandemic, and now he does''.  
 
Shopping was also a problem. There were queues to the supermarket, you had to queue 
for an hour just to get in. '''I could only go to the supermarket when my son was with his 
father and that was problematic. At that time, I didn''t have a car so I could only buy as 
much as I could pack into a backpack and carry back to the house''. Because at that time 
you were not allowed to take the kid to the shop. Not that you were not allowed, but they 
were saying not to bring kids to shops. '''So that was a big problem for me, even the 
shopping, and I think that for many single mothers, with kids, who don''t have a car, that 
was a big problem. Thanks God I had that supermarket close to my house, so I was simply 
able to drag the shopping back to the house, on my back. But beca use you had to wait 
for an hour to even get to a supermarket, and I was only able to do it once a week''.   
 
In general, a lot has changed for me during Covid . I was made redundant, I moved to 
the new house, my son changed schools. I transferred him in September. In fact, that was 
another positive of Covid . Because I didn''t have to drive to him to the old 
neighbourhood, as schools were closed anyway. And he started the new school in 
September. This was also a problem for him, because he didn''t know kids in the school, 
and they are still staying in bubbles. He doesn''t really know the kids but it is only now, 
this y ear, that he started saying that he has friends in the new school. I hope he doesn''t 
remember much of that in the future. I hope that he doesn''t remember much of Covid .""","['Domestic', 'Education']",0,friends in the new school. I hope

a divorced by zoom, during Covid, '''which was a very interesting experience''. I work part -
time in sh eltered accommodation. This is accommodation for people over 55 who 
cannot cope living on their own for diverse reasons and need help.   
 
The first Covid -19 lockdown felt very lonely to begin with. My son spent the day studying 
his A Levels, and my daughter doing her schoolwork. Both were transitioning during the 
first year of Covid; my daughter from primary to secondary school and my son fr om 
 
 
     
 
secondary school to university. That was a peculiar experience for them as they missed 
out so much. But they actually did great, everything was so well organised. For example, 
my daughter needs routine, and her school ensured that a routine was followed. She 
had to be in front of the computer, wearing her uniform, from 8.45am to 3pm. '''We had  
lots of parent -teacher meetings on Zoom and the teachers were brilliant. I am so thankful 
for that. Actually, her results went through the roof from Cs to As''. As for m y son, he has 
a very different character, '''had a great set up in his room, did his own work and didn't 
need anything. He just came down for his food and never talked much about it''. He is 
now a student in Computer Science at Queen''s University Belfast.   
 
'''I felt very isolated during the first months of the pandemic. I was clinically classed as 
extremely vulnerable as I am asthmatic, so I couldn''t get out. And this also affected my 
son, who was at the time working part -time at McDonalds and then he wouldn''t  be 
allowed to work anymore as he was living with me. So, we were all stuck in the house 
because of that.  At that time, (XXX) kitchen, in Dundonald, were delivering meals to us.''    
 
At work, the communal lounge was closed, so the tenants in sheltered accommodation 
also felt extremely lonely. They couldn''t get together anywhere, you see. And I would 
phone them everyday to see how they were getting on. And phone call after phone call 
it was all about how horrible life was for them! '''It was too much for me, listening to this 
all the time. I was a shoulder to cry on, 36 tenants I was phoning everyday, including 
holidays, but I had no shoulders. I felt so exhausted''. Thankfully, I went back  to work in 
August 2020. My employers were brilliant, they paid my wages in full throughout the 
pandemic. I know so many people who lost their wages, that I feel very grateful to my 
employers.   
 
What really saved me from the loneliness and sense of isolation was the neighbours in 
the street. First, we started a whatsapp group to help each other out.  As there were very 
large queues at the supermarket, someone would just get the shopping done and b uy 
multipacks. And it was like '''I've got a bag full of oranges, anybody needs oranges? That 
is how I started building friendships with people I never knew, and this developed in a 
way that I had never imagined. I now feel we are all part of a big family. M y children and 
I, we feel safe here, very secure. The pandemic made me really appreciate the value of 
building new friendships''. You see, I didn''t know people in the street before Covid. Just 
'''hello''.   
 
'''Then we started creating a collective garden in the alleyways. Starting the garden was 
amazing''. You see, we have no gardens in our houses here. Then one of the neighbours 
said, as a joke, that she needed a garden for her disabled child. And then we made it 
happen. A lot of work still needs to be done, but we all now have a shared garden we 
can go to and sit down. We already had al l sort of gatherings there: Bingo, Summer 
parties, Christmas Carols. That is a great positive effect from Covid, '''so it was not all just 
putting our heads down''. ""","['Education', 'Domestic']",0,My name is Oonagh. I live in
United States,""" I am Patrick, I''m 74 years old and I live in the center of Dublin. My wife died 
nearly 9 years ago. I have travelled a lot since then. Travelling keeps me young and 
engaged in the world. The pandemic stalled this. I know it''s annoying for young people 
not being able to travel but if you''re held back at 18 or 19 you can go when you''re 22. 
But you don''t really have that chance when you''re older. '''I approached [the pandemic] 
with a very open mind. We''re living through something very unique and unu sual times, 
and the main thing is to get through it. So better to do what you are being asked to do''.   
I had to cocoon for a while I think it was something everyone over 65 had to do at 
different times. This '''put a halt to a lot of my social interaction and sense of discovery 
and sense of having something to do in the world in my retirement''. When I didn''t have 
to cocoon and could go to the supermarket again it was great that '' '''you didn''t have to 
show a piece of paper to a police officer. Whereas if I''d been living in France or in Spain 
I would have had to.'' Compared to other countries the restrictions here  weren''t that bad. 
Some of my friends told me about restrictions being tougher in other countries. I 
remember the police in England going into parks and '''separating people and being 
really heavy about it''. We didn''t experience that here which I think was g ood. I felt most 
people were '''kept in line by an approach that was for the most part not heavy handed''.    
 
 
     
 
Not being able to greet people like I normally would was a challenge for me. '''Even just 
shaking hands with somebody, suddenly that was gone. That whole sense of human 
contact which for me is a vital thing wasn''t allowed''. I am '''a very tactile person'' so not 
being able to hug was very difficult for me. During the pandemic I felt people were af raid 
of other people. I feel now we have lost that fear and I feel safe enough to connect with 
other people again. Connecting with people is very important to me. The p andemic 
halted that for me. My Italian neighbor, Elena organised for some of us in our apartment 
block to meet during the various lockdowns. We all sat apart from each other, but it gave 
us an opportunity to connect. Elena shopped for me when I was cocooni ng and when I 
had Covid.   
I caught Covid travelling to England in October. I got free antigen tests when I was there, 
and I used them when I got home and started feeling sick. Then I called my doctor who 
put me in touch with the HSE [Health Service Executive]. A nice woman called m e that 
evening and asked if I was mobile. I said I could cycle or get a bus, but she said they''d 
get me a taxi. So, they sent a taxi to bring me to the test center. I had the test in the taxi 
and then I was brought home again. '''It was brilliant. My whole e xperience was very 
good''. I think it was great that the HSE [Health Service Executive] had it in their budget 
to bring people to the test center who lived alone or didn''t have a car. '''Somebody was 
really thinking outside of the box''. They gave me a box of 50 masks which was great too. 
I think we should have been given free antigen tests in Ireland and that we should have 
been wearing masks sooner than we were.   
I am vaccinated. Some of my friends aren''t but that''s their choice. I don''t understand it, 
but I accept it. I get annoyed with '''anti vaxers who go out and cause problems 
demonstrating in the street. I just feel what the feck are they wasting everybody''s ti me 
for. If you don''t want to do it as a private individual '' don''t, fine that''s your choice. But 
there are certain things that you should do just for everybody''s good. Like wear the mask 
if you''re going on public transport and obey some rules as common civ ility. It''s not a 
huge amount to ask.'' We don''t need to have an antigovernment mentality just for the 
sake of it. I find that for some people being against the vaccine is '''practically a religion''. 
I recently met a woman who was very against the vaccine and  the government. I said to 
her you''re lucky to live in Ireland, where you have a choice about the vaccine and '''you 
have the right to feel as you do. But I have the right to very strongly disagree with you.''

Ireland,"""My name is Cian, and I am 67 years old. At the beginning of the outbreak of 
the Covid 19, I was living alone on a family farm based in a rural area of a county in 
Ireland. My days were occupied with taking care of farm animals. But I had zero to no 
contac t with other people during that period, which was terrible. It also does not align 
with my personality, as I used to do lots of participatory activities such as giving research 
presentations or arranging educational programs on diverse issues. B esides that, 
immediately before the outbreak of the pandemic, I lost my older sister to cancer. I was 
grief -stricken, and I was completely isolated for 6 months at the beginning of the 
pandemic. Being on my own is not a problem, also being alone is okay, b ut being lonely 
is a completely different thing altogether. '''Overall, the pandemic exacerbated 
loneliness and isolation for me.''   
  
I am a survivor of a terminal illness (cancer) and a chronic illness (cardiovascular disease). 
I suffered a heart attack in December 2019. Due to the underlying health conditions, 
taking care of farm animals on a huge 45 -acre farmland turned out to be heav ily 
demanding for me. In addition to health issues, the sudden outbreak of Covid -19 and 
the restrictions made me feel that '''my life is stuck on a farm which is heart -crushing''.   
   
As a retired health care professional, I started to realize that the lack of human contact 
and the lack of activities could have an impact on my health. So, I started to fill out my 
bucket list with several activities to utilize the lockdown time. Addition ally, to combat the 
impact of isolation and loneliness, I began to learn new skills such as learning new 
languages, crocheting hats, and doing online courses on diverse topics such as 
medicinal plants, cooking, ecosystem aquarium, and shibori, which is a J apanese form 
of tie -dying. I also started to incorporate Indian spices and herbs for healing purposes 
as ayurvedic medicines. I also made a few watercolor paintings. I used the pandemic 
time to keep myself busy and stimulated, and I thought that this was t he best way to deal 
with this situation. However, even though my brain was occupied, psychologically I was 
in a grieving period.   
   
'''I want to emphasize the fact that I was 63 years old gay male living alone and isolated 
in rural Ireland, without having any contact with anyone from my own community ''. 
 
 
     
 
During the lockdown, due to the detachment from my own community, I started to have 
depression. So, I have decided to move from a rural area to the city. All the process of 
moving out from the rural area to the city amid the pandemic kept me busy for a while. 
After settling down, I started to look for the LGBTQ+ community based in my area . I 
found one LGBTQ+ civil society organization which was providing support to its 
members and helped them to deal with the isolation during pandemic. So, I started to 
work  with them voluntarily to raise awareness around the issues related to the LGBTQ+ 
community. I can say with satisfaction that I blossomed a beautiful year of raising 
awareness by giving online presentations on some relevant issues such as community 
support  for LGBTQ+ people in rural areas, detachment, and isolation from and within 
the community due to ageing. That virtual peer support group and the virtual awareness -
raising campaign helped me a lot to address challenges faced by older LGBTQ+ people, 
for exa mple by setting up a helpline for older LGBTQ+ members.  
    
I was happy to take part in all these initiatives as I could help people who were in a 
situation comparable to where I was before. I think moving to a big city from a rural area, 
and involvement with the virtual LGBTQ+ community had an incredibly positive impact 
on my life. I could see the impact of mental health and of wellbeing on physical health. 
This led me to uptake cognitive behaviour online courses. I believe that, with the support 
of LGBTQ+ civil society organizations, educative events can make an i mpact. I am happy 
that I was involved in such initiatives. All this involvement was a self -care tool to combat 
isolation and loneliness during lockdowns.   
    
I also feel accomplished because I am trying to make an impact by addressing the stigma 
and bullying, which have been exaggerated after the outbreak of Covid -19. I witnessed 
discrimination towards older LGBTQ+ people within the community as well as in the 
broader society which fetishizes older members of the community. '''Especially, 60+ 
older LGBTQ+ members are often designated as a redundant gay within the 
com munity''. This creates a division among LGBTQ+ members. '''I think there should be 
more socializing an d educative events other than the pride day to bring the community 
together for a cohesion in these challenging times.'' From my experience of organizing 
social events, I observed a difficulty to represent the rural aspect of the LGBTQ+ 
community. Campaigns  by '''LGBTQ+ related civil society organizations'' need to address 
social and cultural issues around the LGBTQ+ community as this pandemic exacerbated 
them. I feel that LGBTQ+ community members should be self -driven to step up and deal 
with gender -based viol ence and isolation by utilizing community resources, the way I 
made it happen for myself.  ""","['Identity', 'Education']",0,I also made a few watercolor paintings.
Ireland,"""My name is Tumi and came to Ireland in 1999 along with my husband and 
daughter. I have been working as a librarian since   1. My husband passed away in 
  8 and my 22 years old daughter is now studying at a university. I have lived with my 
sister since 2 001 and I have a niece. I am happy to share that I am doing a PhD and I am 
currently employed in Dublin.  
  
Because of the pandemic, and because of my underlying health conditions, I have been 
working from home since March 2020. Honestly, I cannot say that I do not like it, although 
it is restraining me from adequate physical movement. Additionally, I am more fo cused 
at work now, in comparison to the in -person work, as there were always some distracting 
interactions in the workplace. Diverse interactions at in -person work used to keep me 
away from my tasks, such as solving problems for students and colleagues, or  liaising 
with other departments at the workplace. But losing the '''in -person contact'' with 
colleagues and being unable to exchange ideas with coworkers is also annoying. 
'''Sometimes, I feel that I have been forgotten ''. I am the only one who could not go back 
to work due to health concerns. Sometimes my colleagues change something and 
implement those changes without discussing it with me. So, I am lagging and always 
playing with a catch up, which is a bit annoying. But it is not their fault either as I am not  
physically present over there. '''I feel like I''m out of the loop ''.   
 
Professionally, I went through a tough time when, due to the pandemic, everything 
shifted to the virtual platform. Every department needed to adjust to the changes but for 
the library section it was much more difficult. I used to manage a team, and there w as a 
shift in the organizational design of that team due to lockdown. Unfortunately, I could 
not contribute at that time because of my health condition and the restrictions imposed 
on me. Not being able to be there in person and to reassure my team during the 
transition phase made me feel helpless.  
  
I am a very adaptable person with high resilience skills, but the second lockdown made 
me feel down at some point. Even though I am not a very social person, I wanted to go 
outside for a walk but the tension of maintaining social distancing rules made me f eel 
 
 
     
 
overwhelmed.   
  
Regarding returning to work when the Covid  restrictions were lifted, I felt frustrated 
because I could not go back to the in -person work due to the restrictions imposed on 
me by both my doctors and my employers. I wanted to go back to my workplace even 
once a week. I feel that I have lost a sense of control in my life due to my health issues. I 
would feel much better if I could decide myself whether I wanted to return to the in -
person work.  I know I am at considerable risk of getting the virus but, on the other hand, 
it is healthy to be outside for a while, and it has been years now.   
  
Initially, the work policy related to Covid -19 was all over the place because of that 
sudden announcement of lockdown. At that moment everyone is allowed to work from 
home except the library department. I felt annoyed because people who are working at 
the library now are more exposed to health risk s in comparison to the other employees. 
I think that, from an organizational perspective, there should be more options to 
incorporate formal hybrid work so that people like me, who could not go back to work, 
do no t feel out of the loop. I do not know how it would work for librarians, but it is also 
unfair when other professionals are availing themselves of such opportunities.   
  
'''On a positive note, my bonding and my relationship with my family members both here 
in Ireland and in my home country became stronger during the lockdown period.'' I 
never felt genuinely isolated or lonely. I was also involved in an online drama club, and 
we did all our rehearsals virtually. So, regarding my personal life, I did not feel isolated 
at all. But I also do not want to be accustomed to such a lifestyle for a long time. However, 
the work policy regarding Covid -19 also helped me. I had been diagnos ed with a 
chronic illness after the outbreak of Covid -19. Due to the nature of Covid -19 work policy, 
I was able to work from home instead of taking sick leave. This was financially beneficial 
for me, and I feel grateful for that. ""","['Workplace', 'Education']",0,My name is Tumi and came to
Ireland,"""I am Orla, a retired schoolteacher, turning 67 now. In early February 2020, 
while travelling to London to meet my son, I heard the news about a new virus. People 
 
 
     
 
were very cautious, but I was reassuring myself by saying that this virus won''t spread in 
Ireland. But exactly after one month, in March, we got the news about the new virus here. 
Just before Saint Patrick's Day, we got the announcement of a lockdown which imposed 
restrictions on travel beyond 2 kilometers. But the nearest grocery shop for me w as 
around 3 kilometers away. So, I was a bit concerned and I considered going to the 
grocery shop once every 10 days. At that time, I was living alone as my son was d oing a 
PhD in London. But then my son came back from London  and he was working from 
home.   
  
One of my friends told me that '''I was one of the very luckiest ones as I was not on my 
own during the lockdowns.'' Besides that, I was not over 70 years old, so didn''t need to 
cocoon. I felt sorry for some of the neighbours who were living on their own and who 
were in their 70s, with underlying health conditions. I was trying to help them by 
dropping my phone number in their letterbox asking if they wanted me to pick up 
anything from the grocery shop.   
  
During the first lockdown, people were accustomed to walking a lot. Also, the weather 
was lovely because it was summertime. I love gardening and there was a shop that used 
to sell gas and diesel, but later they started to sell garden plants and fresh poult ry to 
help people around here. So, I used to go there to buy plants, or if I ran out of milk or 
meat. I like the way everyone came forward to support each other at the community 
level.  
 
But '''the way the media was broadcasting news regarding the Covid -19 virus and deaths 
that was spreading a dreadful negativity. That made me feel helpless''. Especially the 
images and news from Italy: the way hospitals turned into morgues and the way the 
coffins were lined up, that made me feel frightened. One day, I was  on my way back 
walking from the grocery shop, and the road was very quiet. I think I had a hallucination 
as I saw an image of a coffin that was sort of wrapped up.  It was one of the lowest d ays 
at that time when there was no information on where we were heading.   
  
When the restriction lifted from 2 km to 5 km, I went to meet my sister for her birthday. 
We sat on a wall with a flask of tea, scones and we maintained the two meters distance. 
Later, after the travel restrictions were lifted, we went to my brother's hous e to celebrate 
his 70th birthday.  One of the saddest moments I can remember was when my friend 
died, and we could not even see her. Her coffin was outside of the church and people 
could not attend the funeral. I don''t know how the family felt but I wanted  to meet them, 
I wanted to talk to them, but Covid  made it difficult. That was a difficult situation.  
  
There was one funny situation too when my other son came back from London. There 
were restrictions due to the Covid -19 situation in London and he could not travel with 
me in my car from Dublin airport. So, I decided to leave the car outside of the airport 
and took a bus from Dublin to my county. It was a bit of a funny and adventurous 
situation, but I had to do this du e to the restrictions. I think what I did was the right thing 
because we needed to be careful, and we needed to have this kind of awareness a bout 
 
 
     
 
our responsibility towards others.  
  
I found the second lockdown a bit longer, but we were much more prepared in 
comparison to the first lockdown. I was not afraid as an older female because my sons 
were here. I am on my own now, but I am lucky to have a dog. He is my shield now.  
  
I am so glad that I am retired because otherwise I would have to have more social 
interactions. I spared all the technology -related challenges during the first lockdown. 
Then during the second lockdown, I decided to learn new ways of communicating. Thus, 
I got involved with online groups for interactive activities where I got to meet lots of 
people and I learnt how to use technology for communication.  
  
However, Covid  has not gone away. I think that Covid  made some people fearful, and 
we don''t know how long it would take to vanish away. I felt those ways of self -isolation 
seemed like a self -imposed prison. '''I feel those imposed rules of lockdown made people 
more fearful not because of Covid  but rather more about breaking the rules. It became 
more severe on elder people.'' ""","['Education', 'Healthcare']",0,"think that Covid made some people fearful,"
Ireland,"""My name is Gerri, I''m 35. I''ve lived in Ireland since 2018 after moving here 
from Southern Africa. Life was difficult in my home country. I heard Ireland is a good 
place to move to, so I came here. When I arrived the reception centre was full, so I was 
brought to a centre in West Dublin. I made a lot of friends there. They''ve helped me a 
lot especially since I had my son Lorcan. He''s 2 now, it''s just him and me. I got pregnant 
shortly after arriving in Ireland, which was unexpected. My pregnancy  was tough

emotionally, trying to get my head around having a baby on my own.   
 
'''Things were fine until Covid. Covid ruined everything'' - getting my residency papers 
and housing assistance took a long time because of it. When I got my papers, I could 
apply for a house. But '''the council took about 6 months to approve my housing 
applicat ion. Normally it would take about 8 weeks but because of the pandemic it took 
nearly 6 months''. That was all stressful. '''My mental health was bad during Covid. I 
thought I was going to go crazy because there was so much going on. At some point 
you get frus trated '' you''re going to college; you just got your papers, and you have a 
baby.'' Before the pandemic '''things were much easier, there was better support.'' I had 
so much to deal with during Covid, since moving to Ireland I''ve had a lot to deal with. I 
found  it difficult emotionally to leave the hostel, I went into '''shock, I was thinking '' I have 
to be in college, and I have no one to take care of Lorcan. Those fears actually made me 
cling'' to the center because '''people were willing to help'' there. After movi ng I kept 
going back because I was very lonely in the apartment. I used to leave Lorcan in the 
centre with friends while I went to college.  
 
I am in my second year of a business diploma, my apartment is near where I study so 
that''s handy. Initially, I didn''t want to take this apartment because it''s on the 6th floor and 
there''s nowhere for Lorcan to play. But Mary in the Irish Refugee Council sa id I''d be silly 
not to because there are so many people waiting for houses. She helped me to get my 
papers and to find my apartment. The management in the centre helped me too.  
 
When I started college, classes were online because of Covid. '''In a way that turned out 
great for me because I couldn''t find a creche for Lorcan.'' Because I didn''t have childcare, 
'''I would wake up and do my classes. When he''d wake up, I''d make him somethin g to 
eat, turn on the TV for him and do my classes for the rest of the day.'' If Lorcan was crying, 
I''d have to leave class early. When he did start going to creche that was hard too because 
he kept getting sick from the other kids. Another thing was he''s n ot used to playing with 
other children because of all the lockdowns and he was biting kids. After a few 
complaints they said he couldn''t go to their creche anymore. It took a while, but I found 
another creche. I only bring him for a few hours not a full da y because he''d get frustrated 
and fight with the other children. He has a lot of problems '''socially connecting and he 
was a bit slower walking and he''s not talking yet.''  
 
 Having a baby on my own was tough enough and then Covid happened. I couldn''t go 
to the mother and baby classes I''d signed up for. We did some stuff online but it wasn''t 
the same '' no emotional connection. Lorcan and me both missed out. '''Normally he''d be 
meeting other children for his social development, but he''s been in the house only with 
me. We have a 33 -year age difference, so we don''t really have much in common! He 
should be playing. I don''t enjoy playing and with me having no clue what to do with a 
baby, it makes it difficult for me and for him. I think Covid had a huge impact on social 
skills in children and in adults as well. I could be out there interacting with other Moms 
getting tips, seeing other people really helps.''  
 
 
 
     
 
I worked part -time as a care assistant during Covid. I want the best for my baby. To get 
the best out of life you need to work hard. I do agency work now in a care home. I prefer

'''12-hour shifts and then I come back and take Lorcan to creche and then I go to college. 
Sometimes I sleep on my break at work and then probably an hour or 2 before I go to 
work.'' Thankfully, I finish college in April! I''m thinking about going on to get my degree

United States,"""My name in Grainne. I am 49 years old, and I am a wheelchair user. I have a 
house in the city but live between this house and my parents'' house in the countryside. 
I am the primary carer of my older brother who has a learning disability. I share the care 
with one of my sisters, so I spent half of my time in the country house with him.  Both my 
parents are dead. I have another sister who lives in the city and is the mother of two, a 
baby and a toddler.   
 
I have very good memories of the first lockdown as the whole family gathered at our 
parents'' house. We were there together for a few months - my two sisters, my brother, 
brother -in law, niece and nephews. The weather that spring was splendid; we were 
outsid e in the garden most of the time, and as one of my sisters is a great cook, she was 
 
 
     
 
preparing good food every day for the whole family, while I played with my wee nephew.    
 
'''When the first lockdown started, my main concern was for my older brother who has a 
learning disability and goes daily to a daycare centre''. He came back one day and said 
that day members were excluded in order to protect the residents. And I thought, oh my 
goodness, that is going to be a problem, my brother is going to be heartbroken, 
because he absolutely adores that centre. I was very worried about him and also about 
how we were going to manage him and his expectations. He is autistic, doesn''t read 
book s and is not on social media. So his only interaction is with the people at the daycare 
centre, and with us.  I wondered how we were going to entertain him and how all this 
was going to impact on the rest of the family.   
 
After the first lockdown restrictions were lifted during the summer, things moved on. My 
brother -in-law had to go back to the city to work. Come July, and I was getting paler and 
paler, didn''t have any energy at all. My sisters said, '''you need to get your bloods 
checked'' '' because, you know, '''I suffer from chronic anemia'' - but I of course ignored 
them. '''I didn''t want to go to the GP or to the nurses in the middle of a pandemic''.  When 
I finally decided to go to the GP - in August - '''my hemoglobin levels were  so shockingly 
low that I was told to go straight to hospital''. So, one of my sisters dropped me at A&E 
(Accident & Emergency) and from there I was immediately transferred to a ward. I had 
two transfusions and '''was released early as they were very careful about not keeping 
you for too long in the hospital''. I returned home I even felt worse afterwards. That went 
on for about 6 weeks. On hindsight, I realise that during those first few months of Covid 
I was very low on iron, and that '''if it wasn''t for Covid restrictions, I would have had my 
bloods checked much earlier''.   
 
When my health improved, what sustained me during the whole covid -19 period was 
the interactions with friends through social media - whatsapp mainly.  That was a great 
way to stay connected.  '''I felt even more connected than before the pandemic because 
we w ere all making an effort to communicate''.   
 
Covid affected me mostly in my role as a carer. When my brother was excluded from the 
daycare centre, we were trying to reassure him, saying he would be able to return after 
Easter, then after the summer, then after Christmas. But that never happened. '''Whe n we 
were coming out of the pandemic, other institutions were opening up but these 
opportunities were not opening up for him''. I appreciate that the centre is peculiar in 
that there are full -time residents there that needed to be protected. But '''the author ities, 
especially the local health board, could have done a lot more for my brother. I was so 
upset''.  I talked to the social workers, who were good, but the line managers were awful. 
'''I wrote a letter to the health board, and another to our local MP (memb er of parliament), 
but no response''. The social workers were trying to get him to another daycare centre 
in another village that is very close to us, but the board suggested moving him to a 
daycare centre that is much further away. '''The local board was put ting obstacles all the 
way''.  We appealed that decision, and at the end he was transferred to the daycare 
centre that is close to us. I took him over to view it, and surprisingly he was very ok with 
 
 
     
 
it. I put it to him like it was a good '''promotion''. My brother finds it so hard to adjust to 
new routines (he was going to the old daycare centre for 25 years) but he was able to 
adjust so well to the new one. Which is brilliant!""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,anemia'' - but I of course ignored

did not change. The nature of the job did however change a lot, I'm mostly working with 
younger children and for the last two years I've had to wear a mask everyday at work and 
that has made my job more difficult. I'm training a lot of children who do not talk and not 
being able to use full facial expressions (because of the mask) has limited their training

diagnosis process for a child, I found it harsh and not right that only one parent could be 
present. It is important for the quality of the work that both parents are present and 
especially when delivering bad news, it should not fal l on the parent that was present to 
tell the other one the bad news.  
 
Looking back the covid period has been both challenging but also in a way a resting and 
a calm period. The hospital and my work were very hectic before the pandemic with 
many severe cases and surgeries. After covid hit, we were instructed to keep the 
outpa tient department at a minimum so the ward could focus on covid patients. There 
were fewer infections and all non -emergency operations were put on hold.  
 
I personally have not experienced fear of catching covid, even though I have an 
underlying disease and have been around covid infected patients at work. I would say 
that in the beginning I was afraid of what was going to happen but ever since receiving 
a vaccination my fears have gone away. I always make sure that I'm wearing a mask and 
I'm constantly washing my hands and using sanitizer. Wearing a mask for eight hours 
straights five days a week has had its effect, I've noticed that my asthma has been worse  
and my voice is constantly hoarse. I would say the only time I experienced fear was 
regarding my 90 year old mother. We were all very afraid that she would catch the illness 
and tried to be extra careful around her. But now she has been vaccinated and isn ''t afraid 
of getting covid so everyone else is more at ease.  
 
In my opinion Icelanders have bought way too much vaccine and are being too greedy 
with it. I have been vaccinated twice and I consider myself fully vaccinated. When the 
time came to accept the third dose, I declined and I wanted my dose to be given to oth er 
 
 
     
 
countries that need them more than we do. I think it''s ridiculous that we are vaccinating 
everyone here two three times when e.g. the people in Africa can''t even get their hands 
on the vaccine. We are by this risking that the virus spreads throughout the world and 
then arriving here again and again. It is established by WHO (World health organi zation) 
that everyone on this planet should be vaccinated to counteract (stemma stigu við) the 
virus. Otherwise we run the risk of getting mutated varieties, like the  flu. The Icelandic 
government sent to Africa some left over vaccine that was most likely was about to expire 
and that is so typical for Icelanders, only helping when something is going to be wasted 
either way.  
 
When then restrictions here in Iceland were the strictest my dance studio shut down. 
Then I felt a big difference in my well -being and mood. What exercise does for me is that 
it keeps me '''above the surface '', both physically and mentally. I tried dancing and doing 
exercises at home but it wasn''t the same. I was knocking down furniture and hurting 
myself that way. Being around other people dancing is inspiring for me so I really missed 
that. I also felt that m y job was harder to manage when the dance studio w as closed.  
Covid has prevented me from visiting my family that lives abroad. I went to visit them in 
February 2020, a month before everything happened in Iceland, and I've only seen them 
once since then. That's what has weighed the most in all of this for me.""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,hold. I personally have not experienced fear
Iceland,"""I'm a 25 year  old man. I'm studying to become a preschool teacher at the 
University of Iceland and alongside my studies working at a kindergarten. I've been a 
full-time student and worked a 50% job for the past three years. I live with my girlfriend 
who is also studyin g at the University and together we are renting a student flat.  We 
started living together right before covid hit.   
 
The covid pandemic has hugely affected our studies. For me I had only been studying 
 
 
     
 
for half a year when the pandemic started. The first half year of my studies was great, I 
met so many new people and really liked the university atmosphere. Then when covid 
hit everything shut down and we were not allowed to enter the faculty building and of 
course every social event was cancelled. Then online teaching began and that has in my 
opinion been problematic and really put a damp on my education. I found it much more 
difficult to focus and to study at home. We were at that time living in a small a nd dark 
apartment and had nowhere else to go (to study e.g.). In the beginning of my studies, I 
managed to treat it like work; I always showed up to every class and after class I studied 
at the school building. After covid started, things changed a lot in that regard and I felt I 
became a lot more stressed towards my studies, feeling overwhelmed to always be at 
home and trying to study there (with so many distractions at home). The teachers 
seemed to be reluctant to make courses available online and there w ere always some 
technical issues with the online teaching. It was hard for me to be motivated to wake up 
in the morning and open the computer to see the teacher and all the other students on 
the screen. It felt as if they were all staring at me and it made  me feel extremely 
uncomfortable. It also felt as a minor invasion of my privacy because everyone could see 
into my apartment and the way I was living.   
 
There was also this constant fear of catching the virus which didn''t help with my studies. 
At one point it got so bad that I seriously thought about just giving up and quitting. I feel 
that the whole experience of being a university student was taken away from me, we 
were both kind of robbed of that experience.   
 
Covid has hugely affected my social life. I didn''t see the point in trying to get to know my 
fellow students because every social event got cancelled. I was a part of the previous 
student council and we were trying to organise some sort of events for the s tudents but 
we ended up giving all the money we had raised to the current student council because 
we didn''t get to throw one single event. Me and my close group of friends meet today 
almost exclusively online and we have been doing that ever since the begi nning of covid.

how it doesn''t seem to end has seriously affected me in a bad way. I miss meeting people

full-time student and I have been working 50% the past three years. I live with my 
girlfriend who is also stud ying at the University and together we are renting a student 
flat.  We started living together right before covid hit. I have been working both full -time 
and part time at a kindergarten for over five years now. I decided to become a preschool 
teacher becau se I'm very interested in the job. I used to love my job but ever since covid 
started things have been getting more difficult. My girlfriend for example lost her job 
due to covid and has been going forth and back with various jobs. The kindergarten 
where I  work is relatively big, which means that someone, either a staff member or a 
child, is constantly going in and out of quarantine or isolation. This poses a lot of 
difficulties in running the kindergarten and keeping it open with so many staff members 
away  and a general shortage of staff. For example, one section hasn''t been fully staffed 
for more than a year. The parents were also not allowed inside the building which 
resulted in a lack of communication and the parents being dissatisfied with the situation . 
I find myself arguing more and more with parents who don't seem to understand the 
situation or the rules that we have to fulfil in order to keep the kindergarten open and 
functioning.  
 
Kindergartens are heavily affected by the state of the labour market. When there is 
prosperity there is a shortage of staff in the kindergarten and vice versa, when there is a 
recession there is no shortage of staff. So, in the beginning of the pandemic wh en so 
many people lost their jobs things were looking good at my kindergarten and we could 
easily manage the situation. But as time went by we began to experience the opposite, 
some of the staff, especially those who were not trained preschool teachers and  
students, went on to other jobs and others went on sick leave. Another trend I noticed is 
that so many of my colleagues have gone on sick leave, not just with covid but mainly 
from long term strain and workload. This results in closing down some of the se ctions of 
the kindergarten. In order to refrain from the same section being shut down the  staff has 
to alternate between wards. This in my opinion is both bad for the children and the staff 
since this creates more chaos and instability. I  ́ve even heard so me of my colleagues 
discussing that they almost hope that they have to quarantine in order to get a break.

United States,"""I'm an 18 -year -old woman, a high school student and I will be graduating 
this spring. I live at home with my parents and three younger siblings.  I've recently 
started working part -time at a kindergarten. I got the job in January and right before my 
first day, I got covid as well as my whole family. I was the one among my family members 
that felt all the worst symptoms and I got quite sick. I thought that was strange because 
I've been vaccinated and I don''t have any underlying diseases. I had re ceived two doses 
of vaccine and was planning on getting the third one when I got sick. But I've recovered 
and now I feel good.  
I started high school in the fall of 2019. I managed to experience one semester where 
everything was normal and then the pandemic started. And now that I'm graduating I'm 
kind of sad that the experience wasn''t as I imagined it to be. I know that I could ha ve 
gotten to know a lot more people and more intimately if things had been normal. I 
cannot imagine what this high school experience could have been if not for covid.   
 
I love being around people, sewing clothes and I am interested in fashion. Me and my 
friends started this sewing committee in school where everyone is invited to come and 
learn how to sew and mend their clothes.  I'm also part of my school entertainment 
committee but there hasn''t been much to organise there. We have had one ball in the 
last two years. We were always planning something but then the rules always changed, 
and we had to cancel. I've mainly had to organise my social life myself since there haven ''t 
been any events happening.  
 
Looking back, the covid pandemic has both had a positive and negative impact on my 
life. The main positive thing is that I got to know myself better and learned how to be 
alone. Overall, I managed well being alonell, even though I thought it was difficult as 
well. I love being around people so in the beginning of 2020 I struggled with being 
forced to almost isolate myself from everyone. People were so afraid in the beginning 
and I had to choose five people to be around. My two last birthdays have been weird . 
When I turned 17 years old, I could only invite five people and when I turned 18 years 
old we were allowed to be ten people in the same room. At first, I found that all this 
ruined a lot for me and I developed some social anxiety which is both new and st range 
for me because I've never considered myself to be an anxious person. I found it difficult 
to be completely isolated and taken away from people and when things started to feel 
normal again, I thought it was difficult to reach out to people around me. Friendships 
did not develop normally during this time, especially those friendships I made in the 
beginning of my high school duration. So yes, the situation really affected my mental 
health.  
 
 
 
     
 
During this time there wasn''t a lot to be excited for. I only had my studies to attend to, 
nothing besides that. I was used to studying on the weekdays and then I always had the 
weekend to look forward to doing something fun as a reward for studying hard. That 
was not the case during covid and then everything started to feel kind of pointless an d 
boring. It was also hard to stay at home and study there. The hopelessness of this whole 
thing was also hard in that sense that I was always hoping that things wou ld get better 
and then the opposite happened. I felt a lot of chaos in regards to my school and could 
never foresee how things would be planned. As a result, I lost a lot of ambition towards 
my studies.  
 
I would never have chosen to do high school remotely, but I was forced to. If I would 
have known how things turned out I would have taken a year or two off and then returned 
to finish school in a normal way. I was always thinking that if things aren''t back  to normal 
in 6 months I'm quitting and making other plans but it never came to that.  
 
There was a lot of stress and confusion in the beginning about who I was allowed to meet 
and be around. The first school group infection was at my school. There was even news 
published online about how contagious and fast the infections spread around the 
school.  Then we were forced to attend and everyone got upset about it. The most 
stressful thing for me was the thought that I could infect someone, especially older 
people. I felt I had more responsibility towards others than myself. I once went voluntaril y 
into quarantine with my then eight -year -old sister and took care of her for a few days. My 
parents made sure we had food and everything but they couldn''t quarantine with her so 
I decided to step in. This was mainly because she, out of all of us in the fa mily, is the one 
who has had to quarantine the most and had once done it all by herself and couldn''t 
imagine doing it again. She is so excited to get the vaccine to go back to normal life. It 
wasn''t difficult for me to stay with her but I felt the responsi bility.  I''m worried about the 
long -term effect on the lives and upbringing of the younger generations.  
 
When I fell ill with covid, the study counsellor and the school''s psychologist contacted 
me to check on me. That was a nice gesture but what annoyed me was that I was 
expected to not miss out on anything but learn everything online at home. I found that 
both hard and unfair since I got pretty sick. I got the reaction that no one was that sick 
now of omicron and i.e. I should follow along with the curriculum.  
 
As time went on, I adapted and now I feel better. The situation has taught me a lot and I 
think everyone has benefited from being forced to get to know themselves better.  I also 
started keeping a journal and that has helped me a lot. I would say that I ha ve become 
great at managing expectations as a result of the last couple of years. Now I don''t 
necessarily expect everything to work out or go according to plan but when it does I'm 
so grateful. I''m generally more grateful after the pandemic, both for my fa mily and for 
being able to go to school now. I can appreciate smaller and mundane things. I 'm 
looking forward to the future and I am for example going with my classmates on a 
graduation trip this summer (if covid allows) and we will be the first class in two years to 
go on such a trip.

Denmark,"""I'm 37 years old and I come from Denmark so I'm an immigrant living in 
Iceland. I'm a teacher and a father and I live with my girlfriend and our three children. I 
teach languages (Danish and English) to 10, 11 - and 12 -years old children as well as 
supervi sing one whole class. Most of my spare time is spent on my children since they 
are all still young. I love cooking and music, but I don''t spend a lot of time on my hobbies 
due to family obligations. I migrated to Iceland in 2014 with my girlfrie nd. I understood 
a little bit of Icelandic back then but to this day I'm still learning and always thinking 
about ways to get better at the language. I wanted to take more classes to advance my 
knowledge in Icelandic but due to Covid there aren''t any cours es available, only online 
and I prefer to attend classes in person. Because I'm already speaking a lot of Icelandic 
it would benefit me more to get a more personalised Icelandic education and I don''t 
think online teaching is suitable for that. When covid i s over I'm going to attend an 
Icelandic course.  
 
Covid has mainly affected my life in three ways. Firstly, it''s been hard travelling to and 
from Iceland resulting in me not being able to visit my family in Denmark as often as I 
would like to have. I've seen my Danish friends and family less than the year s before the 
 
 
     
 
pandemic.  Thank God for smartphones because I've been using that technology a lot 
to communicate with them but it''s not the same as meeting up in person. Before covid I 
would go maybe twice a year back home and my Danish family would come up here to 
visit and that made it easier to be away from home. Last summer I was finally able to go  
and visit them but I could only go alone since I was the only one in my family vaccinated.  
 
Secondly, our Icelandic family is relatively small in that my girlfriend only has an aunt and 
her family around.  Therefore, we haven''t seen them during the past few years a lot since 
we don''t belong in their inner circle (meaning that they are all meeting  up but we are 
not included in that bubble). The same goes for our friends, we have a good and strong 
relationship with a group of friends but we lost touch.  We knew having young children 
would change our relationship with friends but we expected it to on ly take a short time, 
not two years! This group of friends has always been close and always helping with this 
and that and this support completely disappeared in covid time. It was hard to lose that 
close and solid connection.  
 
Thirdly I''m looking forward to not having to overthink and over analyse every little detail 
of my day to day life when this all is finally over. There's so much mental energy that goes 
into planning every possible scenario and catching every little thing i n order to not get 
exposed or sick. It''s been both annoying and exhausting to be constantly alert and on 
the lookout for the virus.  
 
Regarding my job the rules have changed much during this covid time. I consider myself 
lucky that neither me nor any of my students have fallen ill. The school actually closed at 
the beginning of the epidemic due to infection and all teachers went into qua rantine. In 
the beginning, there was a great deal of information chaos and a great deal of 
uncertainty about what should and could be done. I thought a lot about how I should 
teach and what should be done and what not. So much was  unclear and a lot to fin d out 
and fear. I had a comparison from Denmark where all the schools were closed. Then I 
started to think a lot about which country had it right and which way was better. I found 
it difficult to follow all the rules, to make sure that you did not become i nfected yourself 
and at the same time to offer good teaching and to ensure the safety of the children, all 
at the same time. Teachers have been one of the main professions most exposed and 
vulnerable to infections. For teachers, it wasn't an option to show  up for work, they were 
supposed to show up according to the authorities without knowing what consequences 
it could have. What did teachers sacrifice with that? I also noticed that the rules had a 
great impact on the children, such as e.g. not being able t o hug others or get close to 
their teachers. This has had a bad effect as a result, especially on the children who are 
more sensitive or weaker  in some sense. Lately, things have gone better after the rules 
were expanded, so that daily work is more or less  back to normal.","['Education', 'Domestic']",3,I was finally able to go and
United States,"""I'm a 34 -year -old woman working full time as a dentist. I live with my 
girlfriend and we have a dog together. A typical day is waking up, going out for a walk 
with the dog before going to work and then going again for a walk after work. I'm also a 
member of a choir and we practise once a week when that is allowed. I also love dancing 
and have been taking various dance classes the last few years. I'm currently studying and 
adding a diploma to my resume remotely so my evenings are mostly devoted t o 
studying.  
 
In the beginning of the pandemic my work changed due to restrictions imposed by the 
government on operations like dentistry. We were ordered to shut down for eight weeks. 
I was only allowed to handle and treat emergencies wearing special equipment like vir us 
glasses and virus masks. The good thing about this time period was that I could finally 
give myself time for continuing education, like reading up on the latest developments in 
dentistry and I learned a lot.  
 
When everything reopened I started working full time again but I had many more 
cancellations, if people had for example a minor cold they didn''t show up. There was still 
a great deal of fear because there was no talk of vaccinations. My concern was to get 
infected without knowing it and then risking transferring it to an elderly patient of mine. 
Therefore I made sure I wasn''t out and about and self -isolated and just went to work. I've 
actually been super busy at work because so many patients haven''t been sp ending their 
money on e.g., travelling or pursuing hobbies and instead taking better care of their 
teeth. We''ve noticed that people are taking better care of themselves and not delaying 
things like before. On the other hand, many of my patients are in a st ate of bad dental 
health. The older patients didn''t dare or were afraid to show up so problems that could 
have been easily solved have become big and almost unsolvable. Those with dental 
anxiety have been using the situation as an excuse to not to come and  those who have 
gotten Covid are repeatedly forgetting to cancel their appointment. So, it''s been both a 
good and bad development.  
 
 
     
 
 
Fortunately,  I haven't had any work loss except in the beginning. If anything I've been 
working more than ever since I've been covering for other dentists who have had to go 
into quarantine. When you are a self -employed person, like I am, there''s  nothing that 
covers my salary if I can't work. If there isn''t a  patient in my chair then nothing comes in 
and I don't get paid. There is no net or nothing that covers or grabs me if I get sick 
meaning  that no income comes in. It's kind of stressful.","['Education', 'Healthcare']",1,I wasn''t out and about and self

These really have been strange times; the last few years have felt like forever and at the 
same time have passed so quickly. There have been so many events cancelled so time 
has ceased to make sense. The covid years have lacked these highlights over the ye ars, 
like traditional family holidays or concerts with my choir, which made time kind of the 
same and bland. I have felt like I'm stuck in a conveyor belt or a continuous loop.  
 
I've isolated myself a lot lately from friends. My girlfriend suffers from OCD and 
bacteriophobia that has really intensified  during the covid years and been difficult to 
deal with. Her family lives in the countryside and we have not visited them lately, mainly 
 
 
     
 
due to her fear and panic over the covid situation. She would not be able to forgive 
herself if she would pass the virus on to her people and infect others. Her discomfort and 
panic is immense and overwhelming. She never took off her mask even when there was 
no obligation to wear a mask. She asks me constantly if I'm washing my hands and 
wearing a mask everywhere.  It helped her a lot after the possibility of taking an exam 
(PCR or rapid test) came into being. I haven't been nervous about catching the virus  
myself. My sister got Covid in march 2020 and she recovered fully. I'm trained in thinking 
along the lines of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which has helped me a lot. I think 
that this pandemic hasn't affected me as much as other people, especially p eople with 
children.  
 
In the queer world there are usually many parties throughout the year and now there are 
none. Everyone talks about the gay rights being so great in Iceland but the thing is we 
can always regress and lose them back. We've seen the rights regressing in many 
countries. It was only two or three years ago that we got almost the same civil rights as 
others. Five years ago we only had about half of the civil rights that heterosexual people 
had. There were all sorts of clauses that hadn''t been taken out and changed . There were 
all sorts of things that were still in the law regarding homosexuals that were to be taken 
out, like e.g. you could legally been fired for being gay. This is the reason it is so 
important to be vocal and visible and why for example the Pride w alk is important. 
Visibility and events related to Pride are also very important for other individuals who are 
e.g. still inside the closet and searching for info.","['Domestic', 'Identity']",1,I also love dancing and have been
United States,"""I'm a married mother of two boys and a self -employed psychologist. My 
interest these days is mostly centred on the grassroot organisation that I and other 
colleagues are running. The organisation is called '''life without violence'' and focuses on 
women and children who are victims of violence. I''m currently the chairwoman for the 
group. Much of my energy goes into the organisation and being a mom but when I have 
time I like to work out and meet up with friends. The organisation was formally 
 
 
     
 
established in august 2020 when a board was elected but we still don''t have an official 
office space so most of our work is done via the internet. The main idea was to put 
pressure on the authorities to make/undertake a comprehensive review of the legal 
environment and administration of child protection, access and custody matters to 
ensure t hat children enjoy protection against violence. We have also been helping and 
supporting victims of violence which was not something that we set out to do exactly but 
has evolved in that way. We can't turn away people that seek our assistance and say no. 
But the main drive and goal is to point out problems in the system. All the work is done 
voluntarily and without any pay. We have recently started to receive some grants  but we 
haven''t decided on how to best administer them. This is mainly done to have something 
to cover operating expenses.  
 
In the beginning of the pandemic we stayed a lot at home. Both the kindergarten and 
the elementary school that my sons attend wasn''t operating fully. My older son is 
diagnosed with ADHD and staying with him at home was challenging. That resulted in 
us deci ding to get an au -pair in order to survive that period. We still have an au -pair 
because the situations are still demanding, for example the threshold for getting sick is 
so much lower than it used to be, meaning that if the boys had a runny nose they must  
stay at home. Me and my husband don''t have that many sick leave days to cover for that 
so that is why it is good for us to have an au -pair. I'm self -employed and if I had to stay 
at home every time they got sick that would mean a lot of income loss for me . 
 
I'm triple vaccinated but still I got covid last month. It started with my youngest son 
getting sick and ended up with my whole family catching the virus. I experienced all the 
main symptoms and got pretty sick. My other family members didn''t get as sick. At one 
time my symptoms were so bad that I got a call from a nurse and she instructed me to 
do breathing exercises. During our isolation I noticed a behavioural change in my older 
son, he was quite miserable and I even asked the covid team to call me to ta lk about how 
covid is affecting children with ADHD. They hadn''t heard about any link between getting 
covid and experiencing temperament deficiency or changes. I don''t know if this change 
in his mood was connected to covid or just the fact that he was locke d up with his family 
for a week.  
 
I have noticed that my patients have worsened from anxiety and depression after being 
infected with covid. Especially during the first wave when no one was vaccinated. It looks 
as though the ones who got very sick during the first variant are struggling wi th the long 
term effects. Covid plays a big part in the aggravation or some kind of over -sensitivity in 
that the situation gets worse for people that suffer from depression or anxiety. Most of 
the women that seek my organisation's help, have already broken  free from the abusive 
relationship but often they share custody with their perpetrator. It has been reported 
that covid has sometimes been used as a tool to e.g. keep the children in the 
perpetrator''s care longer, a kind of fake quarantine. Or when the ch ildren are not 
allowed to attend school covid is used as the reason and kept away from the mothers. It 
has not improved the quality of life to be dealing with a pandemic on top of some other 
stress as many of the women are dealing with post -traumatic stres s disorder. Sharing 
 
 
   1 
 
custody with another family or guardian is complicated in a pandemic. The school 
system is being relaxed more, so that the children end up being much more at home, 
which can be used by victims of violence to keep the children away from the perpetrator. 
But can also work in such a way that the perpetrator can take advantage of the situa tion 
to keep the children with him longer and make up a quarantine e.g. It is a known fact 
that a pandemic worsens the conditions for victims of violence the system and yet al l 
service is greatly weakened and all case processing takes longer. We have for example 
tried to get a meeting with the minister of education and children's affairs but he has 
used covid as an excuse.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,I experienced all the main symptoms and

centre for asylum seekers ( located approximately 30 minutes from the capital). I 've been

right to have my case reopened by the authorities after 12 months. This has been the 
case for other asylum seekers, but me and a selected group of guys have all got rejected. 
So now I 'm in the dark about my situation and  in a waiting stage.

health to not be vaccinated and therefore risk catching the virus. So now one of my 
biggest worries is getting seriously sick and this fear has affected me a lot. If you're

want to put other people's lives in danger so I've been isolating myself a lot. This is a 
matter of basic human right to have access to medical care. The vaccine should be easily 
accessible to everyone but when they weaponize it t hen it becomes a whole other story.  
 
I haven''t been able to communicate and be around people because I'm not vaccinated.

to integrate or get to know anyone or go to any social gathering.",['Healthcare'],1,I am a 27 year old refugee
United States,"""I'm 37 -year -old single mother. I was raised abroad but moved to Iceland 
when I was 20 years old. I have a master''s in psychology and I'm currently working with 
teenagers with psycho -social problems. Health wise covid hasn''t affected me much. I 
recently go t infected and got very sick but now I've recovered with no major 
complications. I think If I had gotten infected a year and a half ago, I would have been a 
lot more nervous and anxious but now the situation is completely different. It looks as 
though everybody has covid so it''s not as much of a deal now as it was in the beginning. 
I've received one dose of Janssen vaccine and nothing more after that. I've been going 
through a custody dispute with the father of my child for several years now. He was 
charged for violence against our child and after hearing about his abuse towards other 
children, I completely stopped him from seeing our child. Then a year and a half later a 
judgment from the main hearing in the District Court ruled that he should be  granted 
full custody. The case goes to the district court just as covid is starting and it really took 
 
 
     
 
its toll on me and was absolutely horrible. The summer after this ruling was the first 
summer of covid so everything felt really strange both for the sake of covid and also 
because I felt as if I wasn''t allowed to be with my child. It felt like I had lost my child. I did 
not have custody of my child but I was still trying to do my best to cr eate a normal life for 
the both of us. I had good support here in Iceland but it was hard not being able to visit 
my parents who live abroad, both because of this custod y battle and also covid. I 
experienced a lot of loneliness during this time. About half a year later the case then 
went to the Court of Appeal where the prior ruling was reversed and I was granted full 
custody. However, my ex was still allowed to see our c hild a great deal but under 
supervision. I felt little joy from this ruling because I had to obey the decision of him 
being allowed to see our child and make sure that the supervision was done right. We 
benefited from the pandemic as he could not take our child anywhere and the visit under 
supervision had to take place at an open playground near our home. I was trying so 
desperately to hold on to that little control I could have over this whole situation and 
covid kind of help me in a way to at least contro l the settings that they met in. That way I 
could make it a little tolerable for my child. He appealed to the Supreme Court and the 
end result was that I was granted full custody and he was granted increased visitations 
to take place without supervision. W hat I find most extraordinary and so disappointing 
is the fact that there''s been this awareness and attention on domestic violence rising 
during this pandemic. Still, I have not received any help or support from any direction at 
all. I feel as though the w hole system and the government is such a hypocrite saying that 
they would defend and do everything to meet the needs of victims/survivors of violence 
in the times of this pandemic and then finding out that it was just empty promises. I did 
not get an audie nce anywhere. The only person that listened to me and told me the 
things that I had been experiencing were not right was the policewoman who wrote 
down my report. She told me that what me and my child had been going through could 
only be described as viole nce, and that she would not let him near any child. The only 
good thing about how this whole thing ended is that I now have a legal right to take care 
of my child. The detrimental and serious part is that through this procedure he was still 
granted a lot o f rights to see our child and the statement that me and so many others 
made about his violence was totally ignored. What was also overlooked for so long was 
how my child''s well -being and behaviour  changed after she stopped being around him. 
You experience terrible betrayal on behalf of the authorities and the whole system going 
through all this. It was as if the violence was not serious or credible enough. At least we 
did not get the help I thought  was available. Authorities had expressed a lot of concern 
that the pandemic created ideal conditions for domestic violence and that they would 
do something about that but that has not been the case. The government's awareness -
raising and increased emphasis placed on domestic violence in covid -19 is not resulting 
in any actions from the government. Women, like me, have been forced to let their 
children into the hands of perpetrators. This needs to change, so I am fighting with other 
women in pressuring the authorities to take action. """,['Domestic'],0,"abuse towards other children, I completely stopped"
United States,"""I am Gabriella, I am 76 years old, widowed and retired. I live alone, my son 
and his family live in France; I have a brother. For a long time , I couldn't see my son and 
my grandchildren, they could only hear us by phone. In France things were organised 
differently: every day my son could go out for two hours. My daughter -in-law works in a 
hospital. My grandchildren (nursery, kindergarten and pri mary school) always went to 
school.  
My brother works and could not take care of me, so I had to manage on my own. I went 
shopping once a week (sometimes twice); sometimes I also went shopping for two 
people in my building who were older than me and who didn't leave home, or I went to 
the pha rmacy to get them some medicine for them. They had terrorized me with having 
to stay at home. I spent my days reading by the window, embroidering, crocheting, 
listening to the radio and sometimes the television. I heard from friends and family via 
phone an d WhatsApp . I followed and follow the Facebook page of my home country, 
where we exchanged information, jokes. I spent a lot of time on Facebook. I am able to 
use computer. Television didn't help at that time: they didn't pay attention to people 
who don't usually fo llow soap operas, they should have made more programmes, 
including cultural ones. Then they showed all the sad and distressing things, from the 
coffins to the Pope alone in the deserted square at Easter. Something not sad would 
have been useful.  
I was and am not afraid of Covid. I was terrified, instead of being stopped when I left the 
 
 
    
 
house to go shopping to the supermarket. I thought about what I might say to the 
policeman, what documents I would have to show him. I was very afraid because I was 
walking to a supermarket a little further than 400 metres away. That's why I tried to go 
shopping early in the morning, when there was no one on the streets. I counted the 400 
metres: it was roughly a building tour. I was really terrified. I was more afraid of being 
stopped than of taking the covid.  
There was no attention paid to lonely elderly people during the pandemic by the 
institutions. It would have been necessary for a list of lonely elderly people to be 
compiled, with the input of the municipality and the town hall and the collaboration of 
the general practitioner, and to contact them to find out if they needed help.  
With friends we helped each other. The neighbourhood elder citizens' centre sent out 
the phone numbers to call for help or for shopping at home. With some people in the 
building, we sometimes greeted each other through the window. A family who had 
rented o ut a piece of the communal terrace for a party was reported and fined by the 
carabinieri.  
I would have liked to go for walks with my friends, to be outdoors (not inside the house), 
but we couldn't do that. ""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",0,"Gabriella, I am 76 years old, widowed"
United States,"""I am Giovanna, I am a professional nurse in a big hospital; I have been 
married for almost 28 years; I have a 24 -year -old daughter. When the lockdown came, I 
kept going to the hospital.  My husband, on the other hand, worked in smart working, 
while my dau ghter followed her law degree at a distance. Both my husband and I took 
turns going shopping. At first, I had a feeling of panic. My personal experience, even 
being one of the professions, is one of fear. I was afraid of something unknown; I did n't 
know what was going to happen next; I saw so many people getting infected. 
Fortunately, I'm not one to be frightened.  
 
 
     
 
From a work point of view, I didn't have any problems, but there was a lot to do: they 
moved departments, they moved staff. We all had to use masks, gloves, earphones, so 
there were a lot of methods to protect ourselves. We were unprepared and scared. From 
an organisational point of view, I could see that there was some confusion. Everybody 
was busy, but there was a lot of chaos, in general, you did what you could: wards were 
closed or dismantled, whole wards were dedicated to covid; pathways were defined f or 
covid and non -covid patients. I used to work in a non -covid ward - cardiology, an 
outpatient clinic where patients came for ECGs, EKGs, etc. But basically, because of this 
covid we were evicted and went somewhere else. But the life we used to live could  no 
longer be lived. Because every patient who came, had to go through triage, if he had a 
fever he had to go home. Patients who had an appointment had to come earlier, they 
were called, they were triaged, they were asked if they had contact with a positiv e patient 
they couldn't come, they were swabbed. Everything became much more complicated.  
 
We nurses were afraid to bring covid into the house, into our family. When I came home 
they looked at me at first like a plague, because they were afraid I would bring covid to 
them. At that time there was no vaccine yet. So they were afraid. When I arrive d I would 
throw myself under a shower; I would disinfect myself. It was a very peculiar period, 
because not only my family, but also the people in my building, when they saw me they 
kept away, as if I were a plague victim, since they knew I worked in the h ospital and 
therefore did not look at me very well.  
 
My family understood and we tried to play it down.  
In October I changed jobs and went to work in an outpatient clinic, because the 
cardiology clinic was closed. Patients were diverted elsewhere. I felt a bit disoriented, 
but I'm a person who wants to learn. The situation seems calmer to me than at the 
begi nning of the pandemic.  
Throughout this period, my family, relatives and some friends have helped me. Some of 
my friends and I have set up a Whatsapp group where we can relax and exchange jokes.  
 
I think this experience has distanced us from each other. I personally feel stronger for 
having faced two tough years.  
I vaccinated myself to protect myself and others. Meanwhile, I am worried about my 
sister who works in a covid ward. She sees people die, even young people; she works 8 -
9 hour shifts with a double mask, overalls, helmet. And it's very tiring: when she take s off 
her protective gear it's a sweat bath. Sometimes you take home with you what you have 
seen and experienced in the ward that day (people dying, even young people, people 
suffering who you can't hug or don't know what to say to). I think we need shorte r shifts, 
more staff and psychological support. ""","['Healthcare', 'Domestic']",0,nurse in a big hospital; I have
United States,"''I am Maria, I am 35 years old, I have two children aged 5 and almost 3. I was 
in a shelter for 10 months and since July 2021 I have been living alone with my children.  
I have been with my ex -husband for 13 years, 5 of which we were married. Our story 
started normally for several years. In the last two years, first the psychological violence 
started, then the physical violence. Until at some point I decided to leave out o f an 
instinct for survival.  
 
With the lock -out, with everyone having to stay at home, all his attention was on me.  I 
was his outlet. It was continuous violence. Before it was intermittent violence.  
We were both unemployed at the time. It was a very serious situation. Before that we had 
a shop together that we closed and we were both unemployed. I had found a job as an 
accountant, which I left because of his jealousy.  
 
My parents knew there were problems, but not so serious. Being in another region, they 
had not seen the bruises. Once, secretly, I asked my mother to get information from the 
counselling centre on how to deal with violence. They told her to contact 1522.  
 
However, he forbade me to use the phone. In July 2020, a neighbour of mine who heard 
me shouting, at a time when my husband had gone out, knocked on my door and asked 
me how I was. I asked him to make a phone call and called 1522. The social workers on 
the phone told me to get myself to safety as soon as possible and then to contact them 
again for help. They were afraid for both me and my children.  
 
Two days later I was put in a safe place. A relative came to pick me up and took me to 
Rome. In Rome I called 1522 again, I explained the situation, they gave me support and 
explanations about possible ways to get out of the violence.  
 
 
     
 
 
Mine was an emergency, so they took me to the shelter.  1522 was very efficient. I 
decided to rely on them   %. In the shelter I had legal, psychological and practical 
assistance, because when you leave a situation like that you don't take anything away.  I 
only left the house with the documents and the children.  
 
I had to start from scratch. The ten months in the shelter were a break from life, to 
understand and become aware of what had happened to me so I could start again.  
 
I receive citizenship income. Having this resource, they proposed me various exit options 
and I chose to get out on my own; I found a house on my own and now I am looking for 
a job. The Juvenile Court ruled that the father of the children had no parental a uthority. 
He cannot come near us. I do not see him any more. I am followed by the social services, 
who helped me with the children's schooling and other bureaucratic procedures.  
 
When you live in violence you resign yourself, you think there are no alternatives but it is 
not so. Then there are the fears and the threats. And you ask yourself, where do I go 
alone with two children? How can I do that?  
 
You have to ask for help from institutions and anti -violence centres, like the one that 
helped me (relatives and friends are not enough).  
The children adapted very easily to the new situation. In the shelter there were other 
women's children and they understood that they were not the only ones in that situation; 
they did not feel like second -class or wrong children. They had witnessed, both directly 
and indirectly, the violence; they had seen their mother crying or they had seen me with 
bruises.  
Now I am a free person.  
 
When you call 1522, they explain what they do; they don't put obligations or limits on 
you. They show you the different possibilities to get out of the violence: you have to 
choose. 1522 always works. We need to intensify the presence of shelters, raise 
awareness in schools and increase funding. """,['Domestic'],3,"I am 35 years old, I have"

from my partner; I have a 7 -year -old son, with a shared management (two days a week 
for each, one weekend in turn).  
 
I work in the communication sector, writing articles, blogs, scripts. I am also an activist in 
the LGBT community and president of an LGBT+ family association.  
 
In March 2020, I had written a series of scripts that were to be aired. 90% of my projects 
came to a standstill. In 2020 I had no income.  
This had never happened to me before, having been financially independent for 23 
years. I was living in a rented flat, at 800 euros a month, but I didn't know how to keep 
paying. So I asked the owners to lower the monthly rent. The landlords lowered it to 600 
euros per month for one year, but the situation remained difficult.  
 
One of the problems that has become important since the beginning of the pandemic 
is the fact that I am not recognised as a mother. During the blockade it was problematic 
for me to pick up the child from my ex -partner's house and bring him to my place. 
Despite this, I still went to pick up my son on foot by taking the back roads.  
 
Once I was stopped while I was in the car with my son. I explained the situation (I usually 
walk around with my son's documents, declarations, will, etc.) to the policemen and they 
were very empathetic and understanding. One of them told me she had a lesbi an friend 
who had brought the issue to their attention and explained the reality that LGBT+ 
families experience. As an LGBT+ rights activist, it is not possible that we have this 
situation, that our freedom depends on meeting an open policeman.  
 
LGBT+ people who needed to move with their children had to talk to the local police 
station to be authorised by the police. In my case, my signature and that of my ex -partner 
are deposited at the local police station.  
If I want to go on a trip with my child, I have to go to the police station and say when I am 
leaving, where I am going and when I am coming back.  
 
 
     
 
 
With Covid, the whole LGBT community has had problems. At Gay Pride 2020 my 
association made a statement about the different impacts of the pandemic.  
  
My son had an illness, from which he recovered, but which requires regular check -ups, 
at which both my ex -partner and I are usually present. In 2020, however, only one of us 
could accompany him to the day hospital. My son wanted me to accompany him. So I 
went up to the day hospital with him, while my ex -wife waited for us downstairs. After I 
had done all the tests, I couldn't sign out of the hospital and had to call my partner.  
 
I have and have tried to protect my parents who are elderly.  
 
In these two years I was first afraid; then angry, which gave me the energy to react to 
different situations and to put my life back on track. I had my son to protect from a 
dystopian situation that was also very worrying for us. During these two years, bu t 
especially at the beginning, I did a lot of yoga and this helped me. The accumulated 
tension caused me some physical problems with my back which I am still nursing. ""","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",0,"am almost 48 years old, I live"

Shortly before the pandemic, my relationship with my partner ended. However, due to 
the pandemic, we painfully decided to postpone my move. As the house was small, I 
tried to stay indoors as little as possible to leave space for my ex -partner and her 
child ren.  
 
 
     
 
I started a job as a biker/rider for various food platforms and after 15 days the blockade 
began. There was a lot of work, from morning to night. At the same time, I saw very little 
of my elderly parents and especially my mother, who is a cancer patient and had delays 
and difficulties with her therapy. Even though I would bundle up with masks, g loves, etc., 
I didn't trust her much to visit, and when I did, I left her groceries and other necessities, 
the mail, outside the gate.  
 
The lockout actually affected the search for a real job.  
There was a lot of demand for bikers. There was a lot of money floating around. People 
were also tipping a lot: I was getting up to 20/30 euros a day in tips: almost another 
salary.  There are some platforms that pay very little. With one platform I put in  a request 
to have my alias career approved and have me work under the name Mirko, because 
otherwise every time I go to the shops they expect a woman and instead I come in, with 
a goatee, and so they create a bit of a buzz. Let's say that it's a stress, ev ery time, Madam, 
Miss, etc., so I'm trying to solve the problem with the name Mirko. So I'm trying to solve 
the problem with the union.  
 
During the pandemic I was being stopped more than once a day. I was walking around 
with pre -filled self -declarations and my documents. I provided the documents they 
asked for. They never asked me to take off my mask, so there was never any 
misunderstanding .   
 
Now I'm considering whether or not to continue as a rider, if it's worth it, as the work has 
decreased. When I was making deliveries during the lockout, I had a sense of 
apocalypse, walking around in a deserted Rome. I even cried. There was no one around. 
I was afraid.  
 
During these two years I was helped a lot by some friends from some associations of the 
LGBT+ community and some collectives. It was more difficult to be an activist and work 
on social media.  
 
In addition, the government only allowed visits to '''relatives'', which doesn't take into 
account how families are today. It would have been better if everyone could do what 
they do in Sweden: everyone indicates 3 names and 3 places they usually go to, without 
specifying the relationships with the three names.  
 
Now I have started a collaboration with a group of girls for the marketing of light 
cannabis. Let's see how it goes. In the meantime I have an early initiative.  
 
For two months in a row I received a   euro bonus from a regional programme for 
riders, to buy gloves and masks. I had also applied for other subsidies, but they were too 
complicated or based on ISEE. In all these cases I must have made mistakes and so I  
received nothing.  
I think some of the good hygiene habits we learned during this pandemic would be 
good to continue afterwards, for example wearing masks when transporting food or 
 
 
     
 
wearing gloves on public transport.

United States,"""Actually, the first period of the pandemic, the lockdown, was great for me. I 
came from a very hectic work life, working from morning to night. I didn't have time to 
look after myself, to take care of myself, to do my own thing, to be with myself. So, dur ing 
that period, I really got myself together. I lost weight, I was working out every day, I was 
really building my routine and it was beautiful. I started to follow my passions, such as 
doing computer graphics. But, then, towards the end of the second mon th of quarantine, 
it started to feel a bit difficult. For example, at that time, I had met a girl and we liked 
each other. We started talking, but for two months we couldn't see each other. After two 
months of talking every day only on the phone, you reall y start to miss physical contact. 
You miss going out with friends and sharing your fun activities and free time.  
 
I never really understood the logical thread/narrative and everything that happened. The 
real reasons for certain restrictions. After a while, I started to feel bad and to question 
things because, I thought, but why do they ban this particular thing? And m aybe let this 
other thing go through? No, for me personally, the overall picture has never been clear. 
I lived in this state of confusion, in having to respect the rules even though I saw that they 
did not contribute to the general health, do you understan d? So, I felt caged, like I 
couldn't decide things for my own life. I felt powerless, small.  I felt that I didn't have 
decision -making power over my life. This made me suffer, especially because in the last 
four or five years I had begun to understand tha t I could decide for myself. I  had begun 
to understand that I could make wise choices. But, then Covid came along and it broke 
me completely. I found myself lost, I didn't know what to do anymore and so I started to 
live life in a state of uncertainty.  
 
Before, I had been involved in some big projects. One of them was with a collective I had 
created with some friends of mine. We are a group of four members and we organise 
hip-hop, skateboarding, graffiti, live music events, plus we would like to create a clothing 
brand. So, I do the graphics for the shirts and we sell them at our events.  
 
 
     
 
 
But, of course these happenings themselves are fundamental, because at the events you 
make yourself known, you make your music known, your art, you sell your wares. But 
since the outbreak of Covid -19, these kinds of live and in -person events, you know, hav e 
been banned.  
 
Add that to the fact that these other guys and I aren't usually too social anyway, but 
during the months of the lockdown and throughout the pandemic, being social became 
central, indispensable, to the young people. On the one hand, social media was a 
salva tion, it was the only way to communicate and to be together. But, at the same time, 
in my opinion, this led us to cling even more to the phone. Because, then, when the 
quarantine ended, I saw that the campaign of online -only events, didn't end, didn't even  
diminish. Everything continued to go through social media because, whether you like it 
or not, there are fewer rules there and you can show yourself without a mask. And, so, in 
my opinion if before we were asleep because of the social networks, now, it is  even more 
so, because we are really into using it. I mean, it's really like another life, a parallel life. 
And people identify with it too much in my opinion. Moreover, social networks always 
put you in comparison with those who are better than you, bette r looking than you, more 
successful than you. You try to circulate an artistic project and then ... along comes this 
guy who makes two stupid videos on Instagram. The video goes viral, they start paying 
him, he starts to make money, he gets a head start an d you see his ephemeral wealth, 
which allows him to live well and you are unhappy, even though you, too, may have your 
passion and your dreams. It's like a person who always felt that they had something 
special since they were little, they've always felt t hat they would have done something 
special when they grew up, always. But, in my case, lately I think I'm not doing anything 
particularly important, I mean I think I'm just another person going about my life, I'm 
destined not to bring any change, not to do  anything significant, because there are 
already so many people doing it and I'm not at that level and I'll never get there.  
 
The great importance that social media has taken during this pandemic has amplified all 
of that.  
 
And it has amplified my malaise. Over time, with the other quarantines and red zones, I 
started to lose energy towards relationships, I was in a sort of depression, I couldn't get 
out of bed. And I used to blame myself because I used to say 'now you have t ime to do 
things because they have closed you down and yet, you don't do them'. I would wake 
up at 12:00, eat and go back to bed. I didn't have the strength, I wasn't stimulated 
anymore, I reacted to the situation, badly. And today I tell you that I've com pletely 
changed, I mean before I was less afraid, now I see that I tend to renounce and avoid 
social occasions.","['Workplace', 'Healthcare']",1,"I was less afraid, now I see"
United States,"""My life has been affected by the Covid -19 situation in several ways. The most 
important impact on our family was because of the fact that my husband was also going 
through the diagnostic phase of a serious illness at the time of the pandemic outbreak. 
He started having symptoms in the autumn o f 2019 and by January 2020 his symptoms 
were getting worse, his sore throat wasn't going away.  
 
For a while we thought this could even be related to Covid -19, since the illness usually 
started with a fever and a sore throat. However, we soon realised that, unlike with Covid, 
his symptoms lasted much longer. His throat had been bothering him at that p oint for 
several months. At the time, we were going through three months of isolation and 
closure in Italy. So, by the time he could actually go and get an appointment to see a 
throat specialist, it was six or seven months after the symptoms had first appe ared.  
 
Anyway, since the health system was very shaken up by what had happened with the 
pandemic, I realised in retrospect that my husband did not receive the level of attention 
that he needed. The doctors were so focused on covid all of the time, always looking for 
covid, or being afraid of contracting covid, themselves. My husband Paul was one of the 
first patients after the lockdown period to come into the local hospital here,  towards the 
end of May. The very young doctor he saw then seemed like she just wante d to be done 
with him as soon as possible and move on to the next patient or task. So, even though 
she used the small camera apparatus to see down his throat, she missed the tumor on 
his tonsil, and diagnosed him with acid reflux, instead. After that, he w ent to several 
different specialists, and was misdiagnosed repeatedly. And each time, to investigate 
further, he had to ask his GP for a referral to another doctor, then another, and so on. 
The way the health system works here is very confusing and cumbers ome, there is no 
sort of centralised database or anything. You run from one office to another and many 
times you get a lot of wrong information from the personnel at the various offices. All -in-
all, it took a year for the health system to realise what was wrong with Paul. By then, he 
had stage four throat cancer.  
 
Between the late diagnosis, the intense pre -occupation with Covid, the political fear 
dynamics...That period was just terrible for us.  
 
 
 
     
 
Also, if someone doesn't understand the language or how the system works, they'd just 
go crazy. This is because if you are a foriegner, there is really no one to support you if 
you are not fluent in Italian, to help you navigate through the labyrinth of the healthcare 
system. All of this, on top of learning that my husband had cancer, was v ery traumatic for 
me. I can only begin to imagine what he was feeling inside, as he tried to put on a brave 
face. I'm kind of glad, when I look back on that period, that I was rather numb at the time. 
Otherwise, I think that if I had allowed myself to think too much, I could have sunk into 
the funk of a deep depression.  
 
To compound matters further, the cancer doctors kept mentioning the covid19 vaccine. 
And when my husband said '''Look, I have no interest in getting the vaccine, I'm already 
dealing with my cancer, I don't want to add to that burden. It's my choice. '' The doctors 
said he would have to get weekly covid testing, somewhere outside of the hospital 
where his treatment was to take place, and that there were no vaccine exemptions - even 
for cancer patients -  and even though those with serious illnesses were never pa rt of the 
initial vaccine trials and that they really had no idea how the vaccine might react with the 
chemo and radiation that they were also recommending as treatment for his illness.  This 
made both my husband and myself very uncomfortable, and in the w eeks leading up to 
when his treatment was scheduled to begin, we became more and more anxious and 
uncertain about how to proceed.  
 
In the end, my husband decided not to continue with any kind of traditional treatment 
because he had lost confidence in the system, and moreover,  it would have forced him 
to have a Covid test every few days, which would mean waiting in long lines with oth ers 
who could potentially have covid, at a time when his own immune system might have 
been comprimsed from his cancer. Because he lost confidence in the system, he also 
lost confidence in the treatment. Also, the current treatment widely used by Western 
medicine for the type of cancer that he has, often leaves the patient with dehabilitating 
side effects. Paul was worried that these side -effects would be hard to manage, even 
during the best of times, let alone during a time of societal crisis, like this one . 
 
 The radiologist in charge of his case was a bit like a used car salesman when she was 
selling us the program. Like she was eager to convince us to sign on the dotted line. But 
as soon as my husband said '''No, I don't think I will '', this same doctor got super cold 
and even seemed angry. She said with a total lack of empathy, '''This cancer will kill you. '' 
Her reaction seemed so irrational, there was no warmth in her manner or any kind of 
concern about why Paul had made that decision. She never asked him why he  had 
changed his mind, or what other treatment options he would be pursuing instead, etc.  
   
I know that this may sound like age discrimination, but the oncologist was very young, 
like 25. And my husband didn't feel very comfortable with her. Also, the doctor who 
misdiagnosed him the first time, the one who told him he had reflux and missed the 
tumour completely, was very young and unsupervised, as well.  
 
But, to be fair, I'm also sure that there's a lot of stress within their work environment. I

really feel like they should have separated Covid from the rest of the medical system, 
with a parallel triage health care system implemented just for that, while keeping the 
other routine health care objectives separate and up -to-date. There are still people now, 
even two years later, who don't go for their regular check -ups and follow -ups f or 
diseases that are not related to Covid. I mean, look at the general population, besides 
suffering various untreated health ailments, many are depressed and even suici dal. 
There are many people who are put in the position of having to neglect their care needs 
because of this health system situation, this irrational hyper focus on Covid -19, as if it is 
the only disease that exists within our societies. It seems to me as if the healthcare system 
has gone completely backward, and gotten unscientific in so many ways. Now, it's even 
harder to trust standard healthcare than it was before.",['Healthcare'],0,I can only begin to imagine what
United States,"""My life has been affected by the Covid -19 situation in several ways. First of 
all, even though I am an Italian citizen, I came to the country as an immigrant, whose first 
language is not Italian. I found it very difficult to follow the government's decisions and 
constantly changing rules throu ghout the various stages of the pandemic. I have decent 
computer skills, so I was able to find my way around using Google Translate for the 
things I didn't understand, and it actually helped me quite a bit. However, if I had been 
someone who didn't have th is skill for whatever reason, or didn't have access to a 
computer/internet connection, how would I have been able to navigate through all of 
the ever -changing information coming from the government, during the course of the 
pandemic? I would have struggled  a lot more, like I am sure that many others did. That 
said, I can certainly understand how other immigrants living in the country, must have 
felt very confused and very disoriented, especially because the rules kept changing all 
the time. Moreover, since English is the official language of the European Union and 
since Italy has always been an integral part of that Union - and is even one of its founding 
members - I think it would be prudent for Italy to adopt English as a second official 
language. Especial ly, since so many of the country's immigrant population speak 
English, regardless of where they are originally from.   
To sum up, it was very difficult to get accurate information as a foreigner living in Italy 
 
 
     
 
during the pandemic, if you didn't have the right research channels and capabilities. 
Especially, because residents were also kept away from the Comune (town hall) and 
other local offices, as they remained closed to the public for several months during and 
after the lockdown periods. Many of these public offices have not opened to the publi c 
yet, to this day, or are now accessible by appointment, only. In my view, this gives 
residents the feeling that they are disconnected from the local governments that th ey 
have always felt comfortable relying on, especially during times of public emergencies.  
The Covid -19 situation has also negatively affected my personal working conditions. In 
retrospect, I'd say that since the   8 financial crisis and even before, the Italian 
economy has been weakening year by year. Many Italians will even tell you that the 
financial  crisis started with the currency change -over from the lire to the euro, with ever 
worsening consequences to both the local and national economies, ever since. So, 
anyone who is involved in commerce or tourism had already been dealing with a very 
long period of recession when the pandemic hit. They had been essentially bearing the 
twin burdens of constantly increasing costs and decreasing revenues for decades. 
During the early months of the pandemic period, our business was still fairly new - and I  
could also see from my colleagues who had businesses in my area and in other parts of 
Italy that I had traveled to - that  these were business owners who were already teetering 
on the edge of financial insolvency, even before the onset of the pandemic.  
When the confinements came many of us were in a state of shock.  We assessed our 
situation early, and  came to an agreement with our landlord that was fair to both of us, 
to let us out of our lease.  We agreed that our landlord would keep our security depo sit, 
and we paid one month's rent during the lockdown period. As soon as the lockdown 
was over, we gave up the space. We pretty much lost the initial investment we had made 
to open the shop, because we had only been open for a little over a year at that po int. 
Anyway, we felt that we had no choice but to close our artisan business, because without 
tourism and with all the restrictions, our business model simply wasn't viable. The things 
that we sell were very tactile, and people often touched them and tried  them on, before 
purchasing. And, it was a luxury business in the sense that you don't need the types of 
items we sell, like one would need food or medicine. Since we weren't considered 
'''essential'' by the government,  It was clear to us that under the circ umstances and with 
the overhead being what it was, ours was the kind of business that wouldn't easily survive 
amidst the pandemic protocols and restrictions. Nor, did we want to put ourselves in 
more risk in regards to the illness, itself. So, we made the decision to close the shop 
earlier than some others did.And, in retrospect, it seems like it was the right choice.  
The policies issued by the government to help traders were there but, again, difficult to 
understand and to access because of language barriers, and of course, because the 
uncertainty that comes with constantly changing information. Our accountant was not 
always attentive to our interests because we were only a minor client, and amidst all of 
the confusion, she had a lot on her plate. She didn't really keep us up to date with the 
aid that was available, as everyone was so confused. I turned to social media to try and 
stay up to date, and did my best to scour government websites for news on financial 
assistance, and to find other up -to-date information. I think that the government made 
things much more confusing than they needed to be. There was often conflic ting 
information about what bonuses for businesses were available, and the amount of aid 
 
 
     
 
that one would receive was often determined by the type of business that you had.  Also, 
their websites were often overloaded and crashed and the security measures 
implemented were confusing and cumbersome, always with layers passwords, some of 
which even came in the mail, days later. Finally, just when you got used to how a 
particular governm ent site worked and established how to have access and get in, you 
were asked to change your password again! A bureaucratic nightmare, time after time, 
to say the leas t. 
To be honest, from my perspective, in general, policies throughout the course of the 
pandemic often seemed to be irrational and even in conflict with one another. In many 
ways, the overall response has reflected an often totalitarian approach, resembling a  
type of public health authoritarianism that has been driven by fear and the use of 
repetitive, even errouneous information, that has caused tears within the fabric of Italian 
society and has in some cases, even divided whole families. For example, my adul t 
daughter, who had had Covid several months before, wanted to visit my parents and 
spend some time with them. But they said they didn't agree with her staying with them 
because she had not been vaccinated. Even though she had recently recovered from 
havin g had the virus.  So we are seeing this information gap, and these divisions in our 
family, the likes of which I have never seen in my entire life of 59 years. These are 
ideological divisions, many of which are pushed by whatever forms of the media that 
one has access to. And I think that's really one of the biggest dangers in regards to the 
politization of medicine. These differing belief systems can alienate family members and 
other members of society from one other. And this has happened all over the wor ld. I've 
heard so many stories about people no longer talking to certain family members or 
friends, simply because they disagree on various aspects of how the pandemic was 
handled, how dangerous it is, what constitutes government over -reach and what does 
not, etc. I've heard many people say '''I don't talk to my sister, I don't talk to my father. 
I've lost several friends '', etc. So, yes, it's been extremely divisive time in our history. And 
I think that this divisiveness, as destructive as it is, has been another thing that has really 
contributed to the societal decline in the overall mental health of citizens. So many are 
depressed and in despair these days. It's really hard to think about the future, let alone, 
to plan for it.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,"I would have struggled a lot more,"
United States,"''During these two years I was helped a lot by some friends, particularly active 
in some associations of the LGBT+ community.  
At a certain point, given the situation experienced at that time (fear, anxiety, etc.), I felt 
the need to participate in an online self -help group for trans people, set up by a local 
collective, led by a very dear friend of mine, we have known each other for years. Initially 
the meetings were held every 15 days on Sundays, but then it was necessary to increase 
the number of meetings and make them every Sunday, because sharing allowed us to 
reduce the malaise we were experiencing at that time.  
 
 
     
 
 
We also had to deal with the emergency of the lack of hormone medication for those on 
hormone therapy. For trans people who were already on hormone therapy there was a 
shortage of such drugs, which are essential.  
We activated a support network. There was a risk that many people, especially young 
people, would turn to the black market or to some guru selling junk.  
 
Two drugs in particular were needed: testosterone and oestrogen. For testosterone we 
put pressure on the manufacturers and the health system to make it available again, and 
it became available. For oestrogen it was more complicated. Some trans activists lo oked 
for galenic pharmacies that were willing and able, based on the package inserts of these 
drugs (Pfizer or Bayern), to make the equivalent galenic preparation. This was a good 
solution, although more expensive.  
I must say, after two years, that the ties with some people in the network have 
strengthened.  
We realised that we have to take better care of our mental health. Because I don't know 
how those who didn't have, like me, a support network or a psychologist to talk to during 
the pandemic do it. In particular, my psychologist decided to reduce the fees 
understanding the criticality of the moment.  
The mental health of individuals and families is greater than any government bonus 
could cover. We need a permanent psychologist in every school and workplace ''.""","['Workplace', 'Healthcare']",1,I felt the need to participate in
United States,"""I am 67 years old, I live in [a small Lithuanian town] and work as a librarian. 
Currently, we live just the two of us together with my husband. I have three children, they 
are all grown up now, two of them live abroad, and one here, in Lithuania. They hav e 
families, I have four grandchildren. My husband is a pensioner, so that''s how we live.  
Because of the general atmosphere in the beginning of the pandemic, there was a lot of 
discomfort and fears of getting sick ourselves, family members, surrounding people, 
acquaintances. Later, when the pandemic intensified, there were a lot of deaths of 
people I know, there was some panic. But I worked remotely, because of my age. I mostly 
stayed at home, had very few interactions with anyone, children also didn't visit, [we 
communicated] only through electronic networks. I went out only when it was necessa ry 
to buy groceries and bring books from the library so that I could deal with them at home. 
Basically, we didn't go anywhere and did not communicate with strangers [ '''svetimais'' 
(not family members)]. So, this is how life was then.  
Since I am older than 65 years, I was allowed to work remotely. Actually, all of us worked 
remotely when the first restrictions were put into place. Then some had to come back 
and to serve people in a non -contact way, to quarantine books. There was also a period 
when a time limit was imposed for readers '' not more than 20 minutes to choose or 
return a book.  Everything was disinfected, all hygienic means employed. Still, some of 
my co -workers got infected, they were seriously sick, but thankfully, everythin g ended 
happily. However, there was another librarian who worked at school, she was older, and 
she died from Covid . 
 
The constant flow of information [about Covid -19], everyone talks about it all the time 
and then you learn that people you know have died, of course it's not nice. I wasn't so 
much worried about myself, but about my family, children. I guess, I worried about 
myself the least. Of course, I was careful , I tried to protect myself and they also protected 
me. I can't say I was extremely panicky, we used all protective measures and trusted 
ourselves.  
 
In terms of health services, I didn't have any issues. I am prescribed drugs for high blood 
pressure and my prescription was renewed remotely. I didn't need to see the doctor in 
person throughout the pandemic. You get the prescription for three months remo tely 
and just go buy the drugs at the pharmacy.  
 
I felt quite busy during this time, as I wanted to perform my work duties well, to do as 
much as is needed and on time, so that everyone is happy, me and the management, I 
did not need any additional activities. My husband went fishing during the winter an d 
gardening during the summer. We didn't interact even with our neighbours in the 
[collective] garden, just waved and said hello from afar.  
 
 
     
 
 
During the first quarantine, when there were more restrictions put in place, I felt very 
uneasy, because we didn't know anything '' what, how and why [is happening]. However, 
later, little by little, you just get used to it, especially, when you learn what to do to protect 
yourself. Maybe we were lucky [for not getting infected], God forbid, of course it's not 
the end yet, but we managed to outmanoeuvre. My son''s family in [foreign country] got 
sick, but it was a mild form for them. The son -in-law who lives in [another foreign country] 
was severely ill, but pulled through.  
 
I got vaccinated as soon as it was possible, as soon as my registration came up and now 
we have all three shots. I believe in vaccination, vaccines have saved the world from so 
many diseases. Of course, there are interpretations that they are not sufficien tly 
researched, but still, at least something, at least somewhat lowered risk. I did feel unwell 
after each shot '' increased temperature, general weakness, but it lasted for only two 
days. I don't know from a medical point of view, weather the shot helps, but it did 
definitely help us psychologically.  
 
I think people need to take care of themselves themselves, no one else will take care of 
you, no one will protect you, if you won't protect yourself. You need to follow hygiene 
rules, not gather in groups, even though I understand that people want to meet.  Actually, 
I just recently went to one meeting myself, but all who participated were vaccinated, 
those, who were not, did not come.  
In terms of government's restrictions and recommendations [in respect to Covid -19], I 
think they were all put in place to manage the pandemic, no matter how successful or 
unsuccessful they were. And it was our obligation to follow them. I understand the 
outrage by some, like artists [who could not perform/ hold concerts], but human lives 
are the top priority.  
 A lot of people have died. You feel sorry for everyone, but especially for those that you 
knew. A famous archaeologist/ historian [local celebrity] has died, my grandchild''s 
teacher. Some active readers who used to come to our library died. So many people  
around, people that we knew. I wouldn't say they were very old, rather middle aged, in 
their 50 -ies/ 60 -ies. Perhaps, younger people think it's not a big deal, but when we 
ourselves are of the same age, we think it wasn't time yet [to die]. Apart from tim ing, 
another issue is how '' they died in severe condition, suffering. It's completely different 
from, say, dying of a heart disease like stroke, suddenly. Of course, this didn't happen at 
home, it happened at the hospital, we did not see that, but we heard  how things went 
there. Every death shakes you, no matter weather someone's close or not. You pause for 
a moment, but then go on living your life.  
  
The pandemic has not finished yet, but now we have an even bigger problem, 
unfortunately [referring to the war in Ukraine].""","['Domestic', 'Healthcare']",1,"I am 67 years old, I live"
United States,"""I am 63 years old, I work as a financier at my own company. I live with my 
family which consists of my husband and my elderly parents, aged 95 and 92. We live in 
a private house in small town that is close to one of Lithuanian resorts.  
The pandemic has definitely had an effect on us, we were frightened, because we did 
not know what impact it will have on our business, how will it all unfold, especially in the 
beginning. Our life is heavily impacted by our business. However, it turned out  that 
people were quite willing to shop at our online store, so we had even more work. I think 
it has also to do with the fact, that many Lithuanian migrants returned to Lithuania in the 
beginning of the pandemic and travel abroad was not possible, so ever yone was 
vacationing/ travelling inside the country [the business sells active leisure inventory]. In 
fact, during the first year of the pandemic there was so much work that we didn't even 
have time to panic. We didn't need to close ourselves off, I mean t o sit at home and work 
remotely, because we work at a warehouse and our team is small. So, the type of work 
we did didn't change, we just had a heavier workload.  
Our physical stores had to be closed during quarantine, so we received subsidies from 
the state to compensate employee salaries during downtime. This specifically 
 
 
     
 
concerned employees who worked in our physical stores (sellers, etc.), the work in the 
warehouse continued. This happened both times when the quarantine was declared, the 
first and the second year of the pandemic.  
Social life has deteriorated. There were no events, we went out less, didn''t visit our 
relatives as often, we lived a more secluded life, just went for walks in the park. We spent 
more time within our family, trying to avoid any gatherings.  
Because my parents are so old, to avoid possible infection we try to be more careful 
[around them], not have guests in the house. Luckily, they did not get sick [so far]. My 
father takes blood thinners, he has blood check -ups every month (every first Wedne sday 
of the month), our primary care is quite good, so he continued to have his visits during 
the pandemic as well. He has also had two shots of the Covid  vaccine. My mother is not 
vaccinated, but she never ever leaves the house and does not meet anyone.  
Me and my husband are hypertonic, but we received doctor consultations remotely and 
were able to buy our medicines in the pharmacy as usual.   
All the time I tried to be hopeful and stay positive. However, I am so over masks, I'm tired 
of having to wear a mask all the time. I wear glasses, so every time I go into a shop my 
glasses fog up '' you can't see, you can't breathe, especially during winte r when it's cold. 
It's not pleasant '' for me, personally, it feels like my brain stops working when I put on a 
mask. And the worst thing, I don't think they work, it's a mere show, a way to boost the 
economy.  
Me and my husband are vaccinated, but I refused the vaccine the first two times I was 
invited [by the primary care physician] to get it. I just did not want to be vaccinated with 
Astra Zeneca. When the nurse called for the third time and said that they fin ally had 
Pfizer, I agreed. I must admit I was very afraid of the vaccine in the beginning, there was 
a lot of anxiety, and there was already some information spreading about blood clots 
related to Astra Zeneca. I don't know if it was information or misinfo rmation, but the 
media has induced a lot of fear in that respect. However, when you realize that there is 
no alternative, you make the decision and just do it hoping it will make you safer. And 
indeed, I felt safer, calmer afterwards. I was more willing to  go out, I felt bolder as I 
thought I had gained at least some immunity and if I were to get infected, at least I won't 
die.""","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",0,time I tried to be hopeful
United Kingdom,"""I am 39 years old. I was born in Kaunas and grew up in Kaunas, but at 17 
years old I went to study abroad and graduated from a university there. I have a 
bachelor's degree and two master's degrees. I work as a consultant in company change 
management and p rocess improvement. I'm currently in between Lithuania and 
England, as my work is fully remote. My main client is from Switzerland, and I have clients 
in other European countries, but I am employed at a company in England, and I pay all 
my taxes  in England. It's best if I spend 6 months a year in England and I cannot spend 
more than 6 months in Lithuania, as I would then have to pay taxes in Lithuania [as well]. 
So, I usually try to spend around 6 months a year in England, and the rest, except fo r 
some other travels, in Lithuania.  
In my professional life I used to travel to see my clients based in other countries almost 
every week. This was of course very tiring. The Covid -19 pandemic has changed all that 
and now we communicate only through zoom. I got introduced to my main client on 
zoom and I haven't seen my employer in real life since May 2020. Now I work remotely, 
completely alone and communicate with my clients through  internet. The downside of 
remote work is that you must work from home, I don't have an office either in Lithuan ia, 
or in England.  
Emotionally, my life has improved 120 times with the onset of the Covid  pandemic, as it 
gave me the chance to be where I wanted to be. Specifically, I was able to spend more 
time in Lithuania than in England. England has a much higher cost of living, and I just 
can't afford to have the life I want there, I have much better wo rking and living conditions 
in Lithuania. In England I could only afford to rent a small room and here I have a 90 
square meters apartment in the city centre. It depends on the person''s  background and 
his/ her surroundings. It is not easy to be an immigrant in London and in general 
immigrants have to build everything themselves. The conditions that I have here in 
Lithuania were not created by me, rather by my parents, relatives, but thei r support 
ensures a more comfortable life for me.  
I even started to think how I could come back and integrate into the Lithuanian society. 
I have a feeling, many Lithuanian migrants have started to think in the same direction 
during this Covid  pandemic. It''s in process now. However, my second half [partner] is 
not Lithuanian, he's getting used to little by little but it's very difficult to integrate him. I 
think my life will remain between Lithuania and some other country. You can spend the 
who le summer in Lithuania and then disappear from November for a f ew months.  
If you are a hired employee, it's very difficult to change your work country. I guess it's 
 
 
     
 
easier when you're young and are considered cheap labour, the employer does not 
mind investing in you, teaching you. But once you''ve had a lot of work experience in one 
country, it is usually best recognized in that country and not others. I'm also not sure if 
my knowledge and skills would be needed in Lithuania, I work in a specific sphere. I am 
employed, but it's a '''one month notice '', so I wouldn't say that it''s a very safe position.  
I had some health issues during the pandemic '' I needed to have a check -up two years 
ago and managed to do that only recently. I was too afraid to go see the doctor, I was 
afraid I'll get infected [with Covid ]. Now I'm waiting impatiently for the results, it''s taking 
a long time because all the laboratories are busy [with Covid ]. I pay health insurance in 
both Lithuania and England, but I usually use only the Lithuanian one.  
If someone asks me '''where are you based?'', my answer is '' '''I'm in between Lithuania 
and the UK''. If they ask '''what's your address in the UK?''.... [pauses and then laughs]... 
we're not renting anything in the UK at the moment. I miss stability. I don't feel  like I have 
a home anywhere, I'm not integrated into any of the places. For that you need to put in 
some effort '' go out and meet people, socialize. But it was not possible with the 
pandemic. Our circle of friends has shrunk, there is no social life, when  you go out with 
friends during weekends or have a trip together. I'm glad I have a partner, because 
otherwise I'd feel lonely. Then again, we spend too much time together, I'm very happy 
that he's currently away for two weeks [laughs].""","['Workplace', 'Healthcare']",0,at 17 years old I went
United States,"""I am 41 years old, I live in Vilnius. Currently I am unemployed and together 
with my husband we're raising 5 children. The youngest one will soon be 4 years old and 
the oldest one - 13.  
The two quarantines were very different. During the first quarantine we put a lot of effort 
into trying to make the situation as good as possible for the children, so that they don't 
have to experience a painful quarantine. We had a 4th grader, a 2nd grade r, the twins 
went to the kindergarten, the smallest child stayed at home, I did not work at that time. 
We spent a lot of time together, played boardgames, went for walks, travelled locally. 
My husband took time off from his remote work at least once a week  to spend it with 
children. We had ideal circumstances, because we had a lot of rooms and those who 
needed it the most were able to close themselves in - my husband and the two children 
who go to school. Me and the smallest children were left without a pla ce, but I can 
imagine that other people don't have even that, don't have enough room for everyone 
who needs to work or learn remotely. At the end of the first quarantine, we all, including 
children, started missing other people, gatherings, but in general I would say that 
compared to the second quarantine everything went by painlessly.  
Of course, we lost grandparents - I lost my mother, it was not possible for her to come 
visit from Kaunas [during the first quarantine travel within Lithuania from different 
municipalities was not allowed]. We couldn't meet with my husband's parents also. But 
the most painful thing for the children was that they were not able to spend time with 
their cousins and their friends. Still, again, I can reiterate that we managed to come out 
of the first quarantine with very few negative consequences.  
There were some issues with remote learning. It is completely different from usual 
schooling, children lost interest in it within the first two weeks. I had to spend a lot of 
time helping my 2nd grader with remote schooling, I had to constantly motivate hi m and 
act as a mediator between him, his unfinished homework, and his teachers. We had 
similar issues with the 4th grader as well, in general there were a lot of problems with 
homework in remote learning, the teachers' requirements were very high, and me, as a 
 
 
     
 
mother, I was not able to fulfil them. Because of this the smallest children were deprived 
of my attention.  
After the first quarantine there was a period of relatively calm spring and summer and 
then the number of infections started to increase again in late autumn. Since one of our 
children has a heart defect, to protect her from possible infection, we allowed only the 
oldest child to go to school, others stayed at home. The second quarantine was much, 
much more difficult. It was 2 - 3 months of sitting at home, we did not have patience 
anymore to entertain the children and be happy. Apathy emerged and I understa nd 
apathy as a sign that I'm not fulfilling my mothering duties. I felt guilty. It also coincided 
with my return to work after parental leave and this, of course, made the situation only 
worse. Even though I worked remotely, it was very difficult for me, e specially, since my 
mother could not come help me. I'm used to her being around since she lives just 100 
kilometres away. But we did not see her for months and also spent Christmas and Easter 
separately. It was painful to see, that the children got used to  not seeing her and stopped 
missing her.  
I was not able to focus on work, I was constantly thinking about the children, each had 
his/ her own issues. In the end I had to leave my work, because with me working 
everything started to fall apart at home.

United States,"""I am 40 years old, I have a master's degree from Vilnius university, we live in 
Vilnius region together with my partner '''illegally'', unfortunately, Lithuania has not yet 
 
 
     
 
allowed us to get married. We have two pets, we don't have children. I am self -
employed, I conduct trainings, couching sessions.   
Covid  has significantly improved my life, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say that out loud? 
During the first quarantine I left my job and started working for myself, became self -
employed. I am an introvert and need alot of time for myself, so work from home wit h 
the possibility of online communication is a perfect combination for me. Covid  has also 
strengthened the ties with my extended family '' my father, brother, we spent a lot of time 
hiking around Vilnius, as travel within Lithuania was not allowed. Dur ing the second 
quarantine we obtained a little kitten, that was also very nice. Once we started working 
remotely and realized how much time we spend at home, we decided to sell our 
apartment and bought a house.  
In respect to the negative aspects of the pandemic, I started eating and snacking more, 
I gained some weight. In my work I help others to deal with negative emotions and 
during the pandemic I realized that I have to help myself. In this kind of atmosphere 
happiness will not come '''naturally'', you have to '''work'' for it. Also, in the very 
beginning, while we were living in an apartment, it was difficult to work together from 
home, we just didn''t have enough space.  
Another negative memory I have, is when my partner was ill with Covid  and I could not 
visit her in the hospital, because visitors were not allowed. I couldn''t even bring her 
coffee, some small token of normalcy.  
During the first quarantine my partner was on downtime, we worried about that a little 
initially. However, it didn''t take her long to find another job.  
I am sick of all the talk about the pandemic, I understand that it''s difficult for people to 
not think about it, but I try to avoid those kinds of conversations and even news.  
We had a few hiccups, when we wanted to get a loan together for the house. We needed 
to consult a special consultant and the whole process took longer just because we are 
not legally married, but in the end everything worked out.  
We are currently in the process of getting pregnant. I had this idea already before the 
pandemic and persisted with it. Unfortunately, reproductive technologies are not 
accessible for lesbian couples in Lithuania, so we must travel to Riga, Latvia. Of cour se, 
it's more troublesome, more costly, but in general the pandemic has not affected our 
plans in that sphere. """,['Domestic'],0,combination for me. Covid has also strengthened
United States,"I am togolaise and have three kids. Last November, in 2021, I was in 
Luxembourg for two years. I left the marital home on 21 April 2021 and ended up in the 
hospital because I have experienced a lot of domestic violence, abuse of me and my 
children. My litt le girl who was less than six months old was seriously injured. it was my 
daughter's cries that alerted the neighbour on the third floor who came to see what was 
going on. Her father had dropped her and she fell, I didn't even know she was so hu rt. 
That's how it all started and afterwards when I was in the hospital and I saw that it was 
broken I was really angry and I said I was going to complain and they called the police, 
we were in Luxembourg City at the children's hospital, and the police, th e paediatrician 
also noted things down. My other children, aged 13 and 10 (a boy and a girl), are still 
with their father because I left like that, believing that I could get them back like that 
since I don't know anything here, I didn't know that it would  be so difficult for me and 
now I realise that I'm faced with a father who prepared himself well before bringing me 
and the kids in Luxembourg.  When I left the marital home, due to the urgency of the 
situation, I was put up in a hotel by the association, with wounds all over my face and my 
little girl with a plaster and we stayed in a hotel and then I arrived at the shelter on 18 
May because there was a room that became available, and my card expired on 7 June. I 
lost my right to stay here, because I had m y resident permit as a family member. 
Normally today I had to go to the immigration office, but I don't know why they cancelled 
the appointment, and they didn't give me a new appointment. The reasons they give are 
not at all true...they tell me that my fil e is not in order and that I must wait for a letter 
before I can make an appointment when I already have the letter in which they ask me 
to make an appointment, I am still waiting. My daughter, who will be 16 months old soon, 
doesn't have a residence permi t either and it's my residence permit that should unblock 
the situation, I must take her to Brussels (embassy) for her passport, then if I have the 
residence permit, that should allow me to enrol her in the crèche and also find a job. It 
is all going very slowly with the Covid. There is a provisional decision of the justice for a 
shared custody of my children. The justice system gave us family assistance, but with the 
covid, appointments are very rare, and until today we could only have appointments on 
the 10th and 11th of January, and the man wrote to me that he had the covid and that 
he had to cancel the appointment, so it's very difficult. I also asked for psychological 
follow -up for the children, which took also a long time, I fought a lot for this with the 
person in charge of the social enquiry because the father didn't want the children to 
have psychological follow -up, and finally on 10 December I received the letter 
authorising psychological follow -up for the children, but so far nothing has been done,  
we don't know when they'll be able to follow up. They only propose face -to-face 
appointments, because they want to see the children, to see how they react, it's hard, 
very hard.  I have a counsellor here who helps me a lot. I thought that you only see the se 
things in films, frankly I said to myself, no one will believe me of all that I underwent and 
 
 
      
 
the children too, if someone told me that, I would say to myself that it is lies, but it is true. 
I'm not afraid to go back, but if I go back, all the help, all the people behind me here, I 
won't have that in Togo so, I prefer to stay here for the children and to be protected. If I 
have the residence permit, I intend to ask for custody of the children,  and I intend to look 
for work, to put things in place and to continue my life quite simply. Children will be here 
and they will be quickly and regularly foll owed up and I think that this would make things 
better, because it's very important, because they don't understand things, my children 
were born in Africa and grew up in Africa and the father denigrates me in front of the 
children, saying that he paid for a plane ticket for me and that I don't want to be humble 
here, I wonder what kind of humility he's talking about, he's putting all kinds of things in 
the children's heads, it's really very complicated. I just want my children back, for the rest 
he can go t o hell, my children are very important to me.  I don't want to die! Even if I have 
a heart attack I will live, I want to see the end, I believe there will be justice.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,"I left like that, believing that I"
United States,"""I am from Togo and have three  kids. I left the marital  house because of 
violence towards myself and my kids. I am now in a shelter with my youngest girl, she is 
18 months. My two other children are with their father as well. We have shared custody 
for the moment. We were affected last September me and the chi ldren by the covid and 
the situation was really complicated because at the beginning the dad didn't even want 
me to call my children before the judge's decision to let the children come with me, not 
even to phone all that and when they started to come here  for only a month and a half, I 
got Covid and the children were with me. The dad insisted to have the children back.  It 
was to the point that he came here in the shelter to take the children by force. It was very 
difficult for me but also for my 10 year o ld daughter, because she was crying.  It was my 
10 year old daughter who was hit by corona at that time and after 3 days I also went for 
the test and I was also positive so it put us all in quarantine. I was here with my youngest 
daughter it was really com plicated, I didn't have a good experience of the situation 
because I missed my children, I was in the room all the time and I was crying all the time, 
and just after my quarantine was lifted I went to take the children, but the father didn't 
 
 
     
 
want to give them to me. He said that the child had to be tested first, whereas according 
to the covid centre here, they told me that I could because my daughter is also cured, 
she has the antibodies and I have them too, so there is no risk. It was very difficult on the 
phone, I was trying to convince everyone to come here and then I got the te st back from 
my daughter and it was positive and I went back to the room and was quarantined for 
days, it was really long and then it was fine.  
Being ill with the covid, I have now the pass, and thanks to the covid check, I can go 
everywhere with the children. Without it I could not do some activities with the children.

United States,"I'm 57 years old, I come from Mexico City. I am single mother with a son of 
22 now. I studied marketing and worked until I was 50. I was dismissed then because of 
my age. I came  here in Luxembourg with my Canadian husband who was working for an 
IT company.  For the first time in my life, I did not work, I was a wife and a mother and 
enjoyed it. He had a lot of jobs opportunities , and we lived a good life really comfortable.  
It's not that everything began with Covid , but here, he couldn't get any  job when Covid  
began. He finished a good year 2019, and he gave himself one, two months for break 
without knowing what was coming up. So by the time he wanted to really search for a 
formal job, he couldn't find anything. So his mental and emotional behaviour  and 
feelings turn into a nightmare for himself and that cause a completely nightmare for 
everybody  in my home. So , he became alcoholic  and very aggressive, to me and to 
neighbours and everybody walking next to him on the street. He was really, I don't know 
he still is''.He couldn''t afford keeping us in the house.  He became very, very, very 
aggressive emotionally speaking and physically even, so one night the neighbours 
called the police. We never went back to the house because he wouldn't let us go back . 
At first the support services couldn't help me because I had come to the country under 
a private contract. My ex -husband, wrote a letter that he was taking the responsibility for 
us. It's a letter that the government is not responsible for us in any way.  So because he 
had signed it, the government couldn't help us in anything, anything even though they 
knew through the police's statements through the school.  When I got my humanitarian 
 
 
     
 
visa, I called the services again, and they said, now we can help you. You will get a call. I 
was trying to get somewhere to live. And they said, it is all full, call every shelter in 
Luxembourg every week and see if they have a place for you. So I called every week, and 
they said we have no place, and people who are here, because of covid cannot g o 
anywhere , so they said '''we have no place, nor for you nor for anybody''. We have a long 
waiting list, but we will put you on a mailing list. So time was passing,  and passing, and 
then it was magical, after I had a call with VisaVI, a week after, they phoned me to say, 
we have a place for you in an emergency foyer near the station, just be there tomorrow 
morning, and I went there, and they said, you can stay here, you can beginning tonight. 
I had nothing, they gave me a key. For my son, he was staying with friends, he was 20 
years at that time, we have always lived together, so it was hard for us. The last night I 
slept with him, it was difficult. I don''t know if he  eats, if he is cold, but he had to grow, 
and now, he will get married, so I think I did what I could for him. It was an opportunity 
for him that we came here. I've been searching for jobs, you know, but they said to me 
go and introduce yourself in person,  don't send just the photo or CV because the minute 
they see I'm 57, they just don't, they don't even bother to look. People over 60 are not 
seen as useful anymore. It becomes like in these movies, I don''t like such movies, getting 
ride of what is not usef ul. But my time is running out. Because of my visa that expires in 
March 22, but my divorce process is still open. And I have the next meeting in February

Belgium,"I'm 70 years old, I'm retired, I live alone, I have two adult children, my son 
who lives in Luxembourg and my daughter in Belgium, with her husband and two 
children. What I found most terrible in March 2020 was that we were all locked up in 
cages, I felt i t was like a horror film, there was no one, as if there was no one left. It was 
like that for the first fifteen days. I will always remember the year 2020, we had dry sunny 
weather from March to September and so I spent my time on the terrace. I  live in a house 
where there is a lot of space, and a big garden; I was on the terrace and I was looking at 
the apple tree, I was seeing without observing; it was so static, I was like paralyzed. I 
 
 
     
 
could have taken advantage of all this time to work in the garden, to clean the garden, I 
didn't do that. I was stunned. And I thought, I understand that people who are in prison 
go crazy. I thought afterwards, maybe they have more interaction. But I couldn't see 
anyone, I couldn't hear anyone, I couldn't go anywhere, it was horrible. My childr en 
phoned me, but it was to forbid me to go and buy the newspaper at the newsagent's 
that it was so dangerous for me. I subscribed to the newspaper, it was one less t rip. And 
it was only to forbid me things. For them, what was important was that nothing happened 
to me physically, I begged them, to phone me at least once a week but they didn''t. I read 
a lot to survive, I put myself in artificial worlds by reading storie s. I used to get up early, 
but I have reprogrammed myself differently with this situation. I can see that we, as old 
people, are no longer useful. I used to take care of my little girls a lot, and then they had 
to cope by themselves and now they are used t o it. I used to have a very active pensioner 
life, to take drama classes, to go to exhibitions, all that took up time, filled my life and 
now it's the big hole and we don't know until when. From the beginning I marked each 
day with a marker on the window, like the prisoners. My situation is not the most dramatic 
but as a small individual I have experienced some difficult things in my life that I have got 
over. But living like this, took my life force and I was depressed without knowing it, I 
started setting  goals to try and give myself some energy and then I thought I see now, 
inside me, what depressed people must feel and in the autumn of 2021, I thought I was 
going crazy, I had anxieties and these are things I have never felt before, it's a destructive 
thing.  My deliverance in May 2020 was to be able to buy masks, it was already better 
and here with the vaccination it is already better. One day we were on an excursion and 
the lady who was driving the minibus said, now if you want you can take off your mask , I 
was stunned, I hadn't put on a FFP2 mask because I thought everybody had their mask. 
When we took a break, I spoke to the other driver saying that I was shocked that 
everyone had taken off their mask and he said, ah, didn't the lady mention it before? I 
said no. And then we got back on the bus and he said, we're going to put the mask back 
on, there's one person who doesn't agree, I say yes it's me, I don't want to hide. I get 
back in the minibus, everyone puts on their mask and they start to yell at me,  one of them 
says ""you're really a coward"", another one says, ""why do you come to these excursions 
if you're so scared?"" A whole world has fallen apart for me, because people I liked very 
much are behaving in ways I consider selfish.  I can understand and admit that people 
are afraid of vaccines. What I don't accept is that people who respect the protection 
measures and get vaccinated are considered to be a follower. So I lock myself in by 
reducing the activities I sign up for because I don't know how to ma nage.  The activities 
that created a real life have disappeared, like the flea markets which for me represent 
real life, a real humanity.  There is an accumulation of difficulties, such as floods, and 
there are no positive things to counterbalance this. Th e only positive thing is not having 
to kiss people, I didn't grow up with this habit and I don't like it.","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",1,"I was depressed without knowing it, I"
United States,"I am 47 years old, live in a couple, and have a child who is 17 years old. I work 
for a senior club in a city with an industrial past in the south of Luxembourg. Our mission 
is to keep older people independent , and we also have an intercultural mission because 
we have 1/3 foreigners and 2/3 Luxembourgers. One week before the official lockdown, 
we have received a call from the Red Cross which said ""we are closing the senior centres 
for six weeks"" and that was a s hock for me because we had heard va guely about 
lockdown but  we were called on Thursday afternoon to close from Monday. We had 
activities on Friday and I decided to cancel because for me it didn't make sense to host 
on Friday and not the following Monday. As the senior clubs are for people over 60, they 
were considered ""vulnerable public"".  It was a decision that was misunderstood by 
people because we have young seniors, people of 60 years old who do not consider 
themselves to be vulnerable, so for them there was a certain amount of 
misunder standing and they felt stigmatised. We were closed until the end of May 2020 
and we kept in touch with our beneficiaries by telephone to provide them with support 
by telephone and we tried to animate the social networks a little, i.e. to propose things 
to them, but many of them are not connected, do not master the computer tool or even 
the equipment or even simply the internet. The telephone was to be there, to be a 
listening ear if people wanted to talk and we maintained a hotline every day from 9am 
to 1pm  and for some people it was a support. We noticed a difference with elderly 
people of foreign origin, often the information came from their country, so they were 
very influenced, if I think for example of the Portuguese public, there was a very big crisis 
in the spring and so people didn't want to come here at a time when the crisis was very 
strong in Portugal, whereas this was not necessarily the case here. We also had people 
who were very isolated because their children lived abroad.  From the beginning o f 
June, we resumed small outdoor activities, but we were always aware of the risks, which 
was also a bit complicated because we didn't always have very precise rules. It was up 
to me to decide if it was dangerous or not. We had to keep the balance between mental 
and social well -being and the health risk. We also had seniors who became aggressive 
towards us - we were sometimes the last social link for people and therefore the place 
where they expressed their frustration.  For those who don't come anymore, we  keep in 
touch by phone, for example, in January we called them to present our wishes, it's a way 
to keep in touch. I found the vaccination period very difficult because I was asked to put 
pressure on the staff and that bothered me at times. I never wanted  to be pushy, I was 
always rather firm on the health rules, and in the example saying here I have received a 
dose and everything is fine.  In October 2020, we went out to a restaurant and the next 
 
 
     
 
day one of the people there told us that she had tested positive for Covid. We called all 
the people who were there to warn them and ask them to quarantine themselves, people 
were really panicked, I have a lady who called me crying, that's it, so I was on call all the 
time and all weekend.  It was an ordeal to call people and tell them that dur ing an activity 
with us you were in contact with each other and that's difficult to live with, but all the 
people who were at that outing all came back to the club an d thanked us for our 
frankness.","['Public Space', 'Domestic']",1,pressure on the staff and that bothered
United States,"I want to tell you about the story of a man (Joseph) who came to the senior 
club in 2010 after an accident, he had problems walking and as his sister lives here in 
the locality she contacted us to see if he could participate in some activities. He has a 
slight mental and physical disability, agg ravated by his accident. So I would not have 
been possible for him to come here and explain this to you. So, at the beginning, when 
 
 
     
 
he arrived here, he was reserved and slowly he started to feel good, he saw that people 
accepted him despite his disability. He is single, lives alone, has a sister, and is 65 years 
old now. Before the pandemic, he participated in at least one activity every day, he is the 
most loyal customer. His whole world revolves around our activities an d the second part 
of his world is his sister who takes care of him. He lives on his own, During the first period 
of the pandemic, he found himself all alone at home wit hout being able to go anywhere, 
to see the friends he had here, and that really broke his morale. I saw him once in the 
nearest town where he lives, he saw me and he wanted to hug me and I said no, excuse 
me, we can't, and he immediately started crying. He  told me about his worries and one 
of his worries is that he only has cash, he doesn't have a bank card. So he used to go 
every morning to a local bakery, to buy his bread and one morning he couldn't buy it 
because he was told ""no sir, not in cash, by card "". Because everyone was so scared, it's 
a big industrial bakery, so the staff didn't adapt to the customers. What also hurt him was 
not participating in our activities and not being able to physically touch the person he 
was talking to. He needs to touch p eople. For him it was very hard. As he had developed 
contacts with people here, they created a group to take turns to call him, every day, 
another person, without us organising it. This helped him a lot too. We also offered a 
service for people who were af raid to go to the supermarket and we did the same for 
him because he couldn't pay in cash there either. It was his sister who reimbursed us, so 
all this to tell you that this man could not have managed on his own during the pandemic, 
he could not stay on h is own, he would have had to go to an institution, whereas at the 
beginning he had an autonomous life and the pandemic almost compromised this 
autonomy. Fortunately, there was this telephone network which went a long way: for 
example, here we started to ma ke little videos which we put on the internet, to make 
newspapers with exercises, recipes, word games, all sorts of things so that people could 
continue to work both physically and mentally. As this gentleman cannot read, the 
friends who phoned him did the  games with him and I think that's great, he was able to 
do equations, he was able to do a lot of things by phone and precisely because he had 
this contact here otherwise, he would have found himself in a situation where he would 
have had to go to a nursin g home. During this whole pandemic, we did a lot of things 
for the elderly in institutions, but not for people who are isolated at home. I know that 
politicians can't do everything, but we must think about the future, all these people who 
are still indepen dent, and we are financed by the Ministry of the Family to keep people 
independent as long as possible, and on the other hand, as soon as something 
extraordinary happens, we forget about all these people who have been left at home.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,"no sir, not in cash, by card"
United States,"I'm 49 years old, I'm a single mother with a 16 year old daughter and I'm a 
special educator by training I was a civil servant with the Ministry of Family in the division 
of disabled people when the pandemic started. I was integrated in the management of 
the centre for the intellectual development of children with mental disorders, mental 
disabilities, I was actually attached to the management. I was confronted with all this, we 
had to communicate the changes to the parents of the pupils, to the pupils, and to our 
colleagues at work, for example to set up a traffic direction in the schools and things like 
that and what was important was to communicate it in a strict way but also 
understandable for all the actors. It was really difficult to communi cate everything in the 
right way. We often had the impression that as a centre for intellectual development we 
were often neglected by the ministry, which was in charge of basic schools, high schools 
and not specialised schools. We were always a bit in the  dark and I think the minister and 
his cabinet didn't know what to do. We were always working, so even when the schools 
were closed we were working and everything revolved around Covid , tracing, who to 
call, who not to call, that was really the number one issue.  We had other educational 
projects that we tried to set up, but it was always the Covid that we had in mind:  who's 
positive, who's not positive, do we have substitutes who are the students and then, at 
that point, I thought well you have to change something, it wasn't just about working 24 
hours a day, working a lot but it was all about the illness. We exchanged emails at the 
weekend, so on Saturdays and Sundays we phoned each other and I could see that I 
wasn't well, I had heart palpitations, panic  attacks, I said to myself, well this isn't working, 
you have to do something for yourself and change jobs. What was hard was in fact all 
these measures that we couldn't control and to find out how to put them in place and 
the educational aspects were comp letely evacuated, we really tried to keep them as 
much as possible but it was really hard to make parents and pupils understand 
everything, you have to know that children with a mental handicap or a severe mental 
handicap needed special support for example  for the tests. Normally, in the basic 
schools and high schools, it was a nurse's cell that did them, but we don't have a nurse 
working in our house, so we said OK, how do we do it then?  The ministry told us to 
nominate 2 or 3 people to whom we would give  training.  We had a 2 hour training and 
then we had to do the PCR tests with our students, it was strange, all the students let 
themselves be tested, it was good because they knew the people well, it was very good. 
But we had to deal with the fear of the parents, at one point frustration, aggressiveness. 
It was hard to manage.  As I was also the confidante of the management, I had to act as 
a link between the management and the other colleagues in the office who did not work 
in the field, and in addition I  was the general secretary of all the specialised schools in 
Luxembourg and therefore of all the centres of competence, so it was a lot of difficulty 
in relation to the closure of schools for all these parents who found themselves with their 
children at ho me. Our teachers and our educators have done an exceptional job, It was 
a very difficult period because, for example, you can't put the student in front of the 
 
 
     
 
tablet, it doesn't work, you have to differentiate between the students, you have to 
differentiate the lessons, our institutions and our teachers were very creative. For 
example, some teachers went every day to see all the pupils in their cars in front of the 
door to see them and bring them something to relieve the parents and tell them yo u 
know what, I'm coming to get your daughter or your son, I'll take him or her for a walk in 
the neighbourhood for an hour so that you can take a break for an hour because  having 
a mentally handicapped child 24 hours a day for 3 or 4 weeks requires energy and here 
we teachers really did an exceptional job, they weren't afraid and there were almost no 
people on sick leave, it's exceptional, it's really exceptional, and they should really be 
congratulated because everyone tries to do their best.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",1,"We were always working, so even when"

participating in all kinds of things, doing sports, volunteering, theatre, all kinds of 
activities and then it all stopped, I think it was the 13th of March. I still remember, I was 
at the bus stop, I was coming back from Zumba, and we got  a message from the 
commune that everything is stopped with immediate effect and it was a bit strange to 
go home and from that day on, I never thought it would last so long, for several months, 
everything was really the same for me. At the beginning, I had  my groceries delivered to 
me, it was also a whole procedure that the government had launched for vulnerable 
people, you could order for example fruit and vegetables, you just had to give your 
name, your address, the number of people in the household and t hat I found really 
good, especially as there was also something funny and I think it was marked in the list 
""choucroute garnie"". As I love it, I ordered it and then when I received the parcel it was 
less funny, I said to myself Mr Macron said that we were at war and there it was really a 
war parcel. The sauerkraut was in a can, and all that depressed me. I said to myself, no, 
I'm not going to recommend it, I'm going to try to find another solution, I went to look 
on the internet and I think it was also the Luxembourg government with the help of the 
Luxembourg post office and a fruit and vegetable wholesaler who was proposing that 
we have a fruit and vegetable basket delivered, so also marking for one person for 2 
people and all that, I thought it was really good, so I was disillusioned when it arrived. I 
live on the ground floor of a three -flat building. There are three steps and you are 
immediately at home, it is true that at that time people were very careful. The man throws 
the parcel into the corridor and  then leaves without even saying hello. He said ""it's for 
you"" and left. So I took the parcel in and I started to open it and I had tears in my eyes 
because it was a very well known and reputable fruit and vegetable wholesaler here in 
Luxembourg, so I said  to myself that it's good quality, but the impression was that they 
had kept what they had in excess that they couldn't sell, and then they had done that 
only for old people, for the little old people.  There were at least 1.5kg of tomatoes for 
one person,  not very nice, I could only make tomato soup, the carrots and potatoes were 
in a really advanced state. I was so shocked by the lack of freshness of the products that 
I took everything out, I remembered my mother and grandmother, I put everything in 
water  with a little vinegar. The other aspect is the isolation because from one day to the 
next there is nothing left. I was afraid, I was afraid because a few days after the official 
confinement, I was not well, I had a fever, I had a sore throat, I had flu sy mptoms and I 
had been vaccinated against the flu, so I phoned my GP and he told me not to go out, 
not to see anyone, stay at home. She gave me a blood test, it's normal for her to protect 
herself, but then we got on my kitchen table, from a health point of  view it wasn't very 
good for me, I put my arm on the kitchen table, well I thought that wasn't very good. 
Then she left, I was finally negative, but it stressed me out and as I'm diabetic, I take pills, 
I said to myself I have to be careful. To go shoppin g there were queues, so I also isolated 
myself from my children, physically","['Domestic', 'Public Space']",1,"confinement, I was not well, I had"
Belgium,"I am 61 years old, I am married, I have a husband who is paraplegic and I 
have a daughter who is still studying and that is important. I am retired, I was a nurse and 
my husband has been on a disability pension for a very long time. The problem I 
encounter ed was that my daughter was studying in Germany (like the vast majority of 
young people in Luxembourg who go to university in nearby countries). And it's this side 
that is hard to manage, I'm not saying that it was, because it is very hard to ma nage. At 
Christmas there was a big panic because Germany had decided on certain measures 
and we in Luxembourg had other measures.  Classes resumed in Germany after the 
Christmas holidays, on 9 January, and once again the two countries had different 
standar ds for the booster. Here, in Luxembourg, you have to be vaccinated if you have 
an invitation, for me it was a big panic, we had to go and see on the internet how to get 
her vaccinated before she could leave, because if you don't, it means that if you leave  
without having the booster, she can't go to the canteen, she has to manage to eat, which 
imposed certain constraints, and we got the instructions a few days before Christmas. It 
was complicated every time. When the vaccinations started, we received the in vitation 
to the vaccination for our daughter, when she was in Germany. So she couldn't be 
vaccinated, we had to phone and you see it's always this system, you always have to 
phone to find out how you should do it. That's why I say that all the parents of s tudents, 
because I've met other parents who have experienced the same situation, have to find 
the time to stop everything. We're lucky because we've always been able to free 
ourselves, but when you're working, it's not easy. What's more, sometimes when you  
phone up you get teams who don't understand the situation, who don't live in 
Luxembourg, and who didn't understand, for example, that she couldn't be vaccinated 
because she was in Germany. What do I do?  She passed me on to the other colleague 
who explain ed it to me well and squarely.  For the booster, it's true that it was very 
complicated. And you spend the Christmas holidays like that.  The only solution we had 
was to go to the ""pop -up"", that's the vaccination without an appointment the only 
solution. B ut there was a delay because in Germany, the booster was after 3 months and 
in Luxembourg after 4 months.  We are in the European Union and they are not able to 
make a decision among themselves that works. My physiotherapist's daughter is going 
to come bac k from an Erasmus, and she's wondering how she's going to be able to get 
her vaccinated: in Italy there's a problem that I don't know about because she didn't 
explain it to me, but she's going to come back and she won't be vaccinated for Belgium. 
I think t hat students are the forgotten ones, I don't understand how the European Union 
can't find a synthesis at that level!. Our Minister has worked hard to find solutions for 
 
 
      
 
students but still. My daughter panics right away, so we told her, for border workers, we 
say that, well you follow those rules. But in the meantime, they had to have a paper, they 
had to do that, so while they were studying, they had to deal with all these worries about 
having all their papers. It was another crisis to deal with.","['Education', 'Workplace']",1,I say that all the parents of
Latvia,"""I am 27 years old women. I live in Riga, Latvia. I have been unemployed since 
December 2021. I studied in the bachelor's program. I worked as a customer service 
specialist. Honestly, when it started, when there was the first wave, when everyone 
stayed at home, at first everyone thought it would be short, everyone initially liked that 
you can be at home, enjoy the home environment. But it dragged on for a long time, I 
sat at home for two and a half years. Travel to work was very fragmented. From a human 
point of view, it remained unbearable. Everything merges into one. Home is everything 
and you can't take it anymore. When curfews started, things were crazier. There is me 
and the neighbours . It wasn't the best time. Along with studying, studying is a separate 
story.  
In the first wave, no one was ready neither we nor the teachers. Everyone went through 
adaptation.  So, I have not met with mine course mates and the graduation will take place 
remotely.  The quality of studies suffered. If it were possible most would come in person, 
no matter how. Everyone wanted to be back, to meet.  
The most difficult was the ability to concentrate. Face -to-face and remote studies are so 
different. Being at home is full of distractions. Listening in pyjamas  is not motivating, it is 
not a ritual that you set yourself up for studying. Many students just slept through the 
lectures. That was a minus. Less motivation, no conscious study process, less 
concentration.  In terms of quality, many teachers did not learn how to use the digital 
environment. There were also technical difficulties, a lot of time was s pent solving 
technical problems.  The students are also to blame - the involvement was less because 
the key is to listen rather than delve into the topic.  No, we will not be less competitive. 
All the work was done with great dedication. I do not think we will be a lost generation. 
Because, however, we were all motivated to get an education. Yes, I didn't absorb as 
much as in other circumstances, I had to do more myself, in addition to study time.  
I had no trouble getting the job done. The employer was responsive. All I changed was 
that I had to work from home. [Employer] Helped with internet, paid for it.  
There were problems with the work process, when the team moved home, the group 
got lost, communication changed, we became egocentric, there was no cohesion, there 
was no working together. People became more real - the true face/ true nature 
appeared. No on e thought is he or she is offending a person if they were in zoom. 
Remote is not the same as face to face communications. One can be very harsh and 
mean on zoom.  
 
Do not want to come back '' your save time on commuting, we can devote more time to 
our family, our interests, the quality of work is falling, but we are in our environment, we 
are ready to sacrifice the quality of work to be in a comfortable environment.  
It was hardest for me to be home alone. I like being in people. I suffer so much from 
being alone. And there is none at home. I don't want to go through this again.  
 
 
      
 
At first we were very scared, my parents and I, until the vaccine came. We were very 
careful, we didn't want to take risks. We didn't see each other for 3 months. Then I 
couldn't stand it - we met outside and in the winter. There was a great lack of 
communication. When we received the shot, we resumed meetings with regularly.  
The girlfriends had a different attitude towards life - they attended all their entertainment 
illegally. I didn't meet with them, I didn''t participate, everyone considered me to be ''a 
fool of the year''. Now I don't know if it was worth, it wasn''t good for my mental health. 
But physical health is also a value.  Now we are all vaccinated, we meet, and we 
communicate.  
 
Nothing has changed for my partner and I. Everything is OK. It was hard at the beginning, 
the craziest thing was that you can't get out of the house anywhere, we are inside 24/7 
all the time, everything is tired at home. We have nothing to share - we have nothing to 
discuss with each other. It started to affect feelings for each other. Then the partner 
started to go to work more often to make space for each other.  
I do not expect anything from this country. Think better of yourself. I wasn't expecting 
anything. I expected health care system to be stronger. I remember when my girlfriend 
had health problems. And the emergency services did not come to her, even when sh e 
was having a hard time breathing, the brigade did not come. The first reaction - we will 
not go, because you can breathe. It is not acceptable! I want confidence that they will 
come to my parents. That worries me. That parents may not get help.","['Education', 'Domestic']",0,I wasn't expecting anything
Latvia,"""I am 25 years old, I live in a small city in  Latvia.  I am on parental leave. My 
children are 5 years and 1 year and 4 months. Prior to parental leave, I worked for a 
regional newspaper. I don't work there anymore, I'm still on parental leave, but I won't 
be back there. I don't know yet what I will do.  
I was still working in the newspaper when the pandemic started. Pregnancy coincided 
with covid . I had worked for a year, I was used to it, I got to know the work and the 
environment, there were no surprises. Covid changed everything, the specifics of the 
work changed, there was also panic in the editorial office, also in the company, there 
was a pa nic that the newspaper had to be closed. Complete chaos among colleagues 
as well. There was fear and anxiety, we didn't know how to do our job because there was 
anxiety. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. There have been no such 
crises in my life. The Big something. Purely in terms of work, the whole routine changed, 
 
 
      
 
there were no events, no activities, nothing to write about. I had to start writing 
operational reports, holding my hand to the plus, all the most important and up -to-date 
information gave me something new, it was harder. Everything is over, but the 
newspaper had to be published, but nothing really happens. The terrible challenge. We 
walk ed the streets and looked for where we could find something. I realized that I don't 
have tolerance to that kind of stress. I started having trouble sleeping due to stress.  
I realized that I was not interested in news journalism, I had a hard time going through 
the news, this negative swirl. This stream of information leaves something within you. 
Negative currents.  
Covid  affected the pregnancy. On the positive side, the restrictions created security. Of 
course, it was difficult to breathe in a mask. I didn't get sick because I followed the 
restrictions.  
Covid time coincides with the completion of undergraduate studies. The training took 
place remotely, which was better in my condition, I didn't have to go to university, I could 
sit more comfortably at home with a big belly, I didn't have to drive, I didn' t have to suffer 
from nausea. It was a great gift for me. A big positive aspect.  
When I went on maternity leave, I quit my job. It turned out that the company did not 
have an airbag. The company was on the verge of collapse, a pandemic revealed it. 
During the pandemic, I realized that it did not make sense to work so hard for low pay 
without growth. It was an eye opening experience.  
The daughter had a kindergarten with on -call groups. According to the regulations, we 
were able to take my daughter to kindergarten because my husband and I were working. 
In general, she was often alone in a group or had a couple of children with her. I re ally 
appreciate it, it turned out to be individual work with my child, she had undivided 
attention. She gained so much, learned so much. I felt privileged that we had this 
experience.  
I was afraid that my husband would be allowed to be present at the birth. There was 
confusion, could not be understood. The hospital differed from the hospital in terms of 
requirements, I did not understand whether a mask would be needed or not. Extra stre ss. 
Every day something changed, there was anxiety all the time. In the end, the husband 
was able to be present. There was also no need to give birth in a mask. It was probably 
the reality of a small town that I could give birth without a mask.  
After the birth, we were alone in the hospital for 3 days, the husband could not come, 
he had to stay with our daughter. It was severe without support. Purely physically, 
because I couldn't get out of bed. It was difficult.  
The family couldn't see me either. On the other hand, I was able to recover peacefully.  
My husband lost his job because of Covid . My husband is a builder, he works with 
Norway, they finished orders due to a pandemic. For me it was a plus that my husband 
was home for 3 months. My health slowly returned after childbirth. It was good that the 
husband was at home, that there was a comp lete involvement of the husband, that the 
husband was experiencing the growth of the youngest child.  
In terms of finances, we had to think about how we live and how we spend, but it was 
not very difficult.  
The period when the shops were closed was the most difficult. Second hand shops are 
our main shopping spot, it was hard that the shops were closed. It was already hard with 
 
 
      
 
money and then it turns out that there are no cheap stores. My boots got torn, I can't buy 
new ones without trying. My husband glued the boots with super glue. That was nasty.  
The daughter is now in endless quarantine in kindergarten. I can't even count how many 
times she's been quarantined, I can't understand anymore. I have spent a lot of time with 
my daughter. I have a small child, have a daughter, have studies. Although it w as difficult, 
but not bad. I got to know my child more. It was a challenge to deal with the child at 
home. Plus, there is another child, a small child. I had to think creatively, look for 
resources in myself. It gave me a lot as a person.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",3,"I was used to it, I got"
Latvia,"""I am 39 years old. I live in a big city in  Latvia. I work in several places, but 
they are all related to social work. I am the head of the local  branch of the resource 
centre  for women Marta, the centre  provides assistance to women who suffer from 
violence. As a social worker, I also work with people who suffer from addictions, as well 
as with families in risk group. I am a mother of four, I raise my children alone.  My Covid 
time experience was original ly related to work because I was on paren tal leave. At the 
very beginning, when everyone was surprised when life changed, I was on parental 
leave. I returned to work during Covid. I am very introverted, I liked that all socialization 
is limited, that I can work from home. In that respect, I am de lighted. What bothered me 
was that the people around were flustered. There was a lot of uncertainty and the staff 
was worried because it was difficult to see how we could accept visitors / customers to 
ensure compliance. My attitude was freer, I behaved mo re calmly. It was much affected 
by the fact that I did not work in an industry that was directly affected by covid. The work 
of the municipality is convenient, it is quite certain that there will be work. Not the 
industry that was negatively affected by co vid. There was no danger, I could work 
remotely. On the positive side, the employer gained confidence that teleworking has its 
advantages. So I don't feel hurt by covid. The sphere of suffering is my children. I have 4 
children, I am raising children alone . Two of the children have pupils. In the beginning, 
there was distance learning from home, and the lack of technical support was deadly. 
We have one computer for the whole family. I did not receive any support, although 
several lists were drawn up and we were included in the lists, but it did not work. Schools 
made lists of families who needed computers. In the end, the teacher called that 
computers were assigned, but others needed more, and if I could give up. I obeyed and 
 
 
      
 
gave up the computer offered by the school because there were families who did not 
have a computer at all. In general, there were no clear criteria for who was awarded the 
computer and why. Social services may have helped with the decision, but I do not know. 
I still think about which families didn't get it, about the families who don't have 
computers at home. And it's not a small group. The surprise was that children don't really 
know how to use a computer that much. I didn't realize how computer illiterat e children 
are. At first I didn't understand how I could help. I was at work, they are at home and I 
couldn't help with it. I am currently facing problems in kindergartens. There are 
quarantines all the time. I can't track all quarantines. Of course, I was  able to take the sick 
leaves the job provides, but the job one way or another has to be done, so I got to hire 
a babysitter. There were additional costs. Government communication and decision -
making could have been easier, smarter, simpler. The unrest in the public space was 
ridiculous. I became sarcastic and nihilistic about epidemiological safety rules, I started 
to disregard the rules. I didn't see the point and I got tired. This time also provided many 
opportunities. I can conduct trainings without goi ng to Riga. I like to work remotely. I see 
it as a benefit because I am not from Riga.  
I did not feel any support from the municipality. At times, even food parcels were a hassle 
- to take a taxi, because I don't have my own transport. The packages were large, 
voluminous and therefore heavy. You won't even bring it home. In the end, there we re 
high transport costs. At first I expected support, at the end I just looked at what was 
happening with irony. State support (a one -time benefit of EUR 500 per child) went into 
savings, it was not like we spent it. For the youngest children, this time do es not mean 
anything special. They know there is a virus. Sometimes I abuse it. I say we can't go 
anywhere because there is a virus, not because there is no money or no time. The eldest 
son also liked to be on his own, to do distanced learning, he organize d himself well. By 
the time he got tired, he started longing for school. The daughter, who is 11 years old, 
wanted to go to school, she could not cope with distance learning. Better to go to school. 
Even now, when there is there is no full -fledged study wo rk, because there still is 
pandemic. Now the children are not even happy that lessons are not happening. It's hard 
to understand, it's confusing all the time. Something is changing all the time. Who is sick 
again, what classes have been canceled?  
This is a test. I'm trying to remain a distant position.","['Domestic', 'Education']",3,I was able to take the sick
United States,"I have been a school teacher for 40 years, I am 62 years old. I live in Riga, 
Latvia. This is already the third academic year, the very first moment was the year before 
 
 
      
 
last, in March when we were forced to work remotely for the first time. It was very hard, 
especially the first week, even the first day when I realized that I could not move away 
from the computer. All the time some works were sent, I opened them all the time and 
checked them. I realized that this is wrong, that you need to live differently (la ughs). The 
experience was gained, it was necessary to learn how to work in Zoom. Slowly, other 
teachers were also taught, and when we got the opportunity to see and h ear the 
students, and they saw and heard us, a moment of relief came. Well, somehow we 
managed, the school year ended. Last year was difficult, because we worked remotely 
for almost the entire year, starting in October. The most difficult thing, probably, is that 
you don''t know whether pupils hear you or not, and when you realize that some of the 
students are connecting and not listening to you. Well, in general, this is the business of 
each student - do they want to hear or do not want to hear. The hardest  part of all this 
remote work is the verification of the work, not even the verification itself, but receiving 
them. It is technically not very convenient and takes a lot of time and effort. You are tied 
to a computer on a short leash. When the very first time we were in a pandemic, I left the 
house for the first time only 10 days later. Since my husband is a sailor, I stay at home 
alone quite often, I realized that I did not leave the house for 10 days. I had groceries, I 
had no one to communicate with, ev eryone was afraid to visit each other. And this lack 
of live communication affected me, especially last year when we worked remotely almost 
from mid -October until June. Somewhere, probably by January, I realized that 
depression was starting, I was missing a living person nearby (tears in my eyes), and then 
I decided to take a cat. And my life has changed for the better. I had a creature that I 
needed to take care of. The cat saved me from severe depression. I was not very afraid 
of getting infected, well, s omehow I did not have such a fear. I was vaccinated, I got my 
second vaccination in the summer, and now in December the third one. I have no fear 
of getting sick. This is despite the fact that I have type 2 diabetes, I had oncology, I''m 
already old. I want  to work at a school, I want remote learning to take a minimum amount 
of study time. We are in a zone of very high risk, there are hundreds of students next to 
us every day both in the classroom and in the corridors. We have a very high chance of 
getting i nfected compared to many people. We are well aware that it is impossible to 
work in a mask for the entire lesson. I cant. I need to talk a lot and I can't talk in a mask. 
So the mask is under my nose. And the children - well, yes, for some it slides off, s omeone 
wears it correctly. Sometimes you make a comment. We are well aware that we have to 
sit in a mask for 7 hours ... And if I ask a student to read or answer something, then I do 
not understand anything that he is saying under the mask. I ask him to lo wer the mask, 
read it, and ask him to put it on again. So there is a vulnerability. we now have such a 
mode of work: we go to school and do not know whether we will work with the class at 
school or have already been sent to a remote location, to quarantine  - this causes a state 
of nervousness. You are waiting for the school year to end faster, for everyone to return 
to school and work in normal conditions. Of course, recently, when so many people 
become infected and if this happens to me, I really hope that  I will survive without serious 
consequences. I have had 3 vaccinations. I find that fear is cornering and harder to resist.","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,I did not have such a fear
United States,"""My name is Muhammed so you can clearly hear that I am not from Latvia 
originally. Now I live in Riga, Latvia. During the war in Syria I decided to leave Syria and 
my number one option was Latvia, because my girlfriend was Latvian. I came here and 
started to study in TSI, I studied computer science. I have graduated probably 2 years 
ago, then I started to work in Accenture Latvia. As a robotic developer. I started to work 
in Accenture and second day exactly from me signing the contract, we were sent home. 
Since then we have started working from home. Accenture sent us monitors, working 
chairs, they also paid us to buy headphones and what ever you want from t echnic stuff. 
They made it easy. After 2 years I can''t say I fully happy working from home. I can''t say I 
minded it, but I would like to go back to the office at least one or two days a week, just 
to break the routine. My wife lost her job at the begging o f the pandemic, so now she is 
sitting home. I don''t know, how would it be if she will be still working. Honestly working 
from home has helped me to take care of newborn child, because if it will be me going 
to the office all the time '' my wife would have r ough time dealing alone with the baby.  
As a survivor of the war pretty much I customized with a lack of products and 
disturbances of life. What was difficult for me is to understand where this is going. I mean, 
is it going to be the end of the world, for example, or is it going end in 1 or 2 ye ars. It 
was hard for me to understand with European lifestyle where is this heading. Is it going 
to be like a new lifestyle that we should get used to? Because usually in the Middle East 
those types of things happen, we usually assume the worst, I mean we are prepared for 
the worst.  
I don''t have a big number of friends in Latvia. I had a big number of friends, but in Syria. 
Social interaction I had was at work. And I was deprived of that during lockdown.  
I got a new kid. Yeah, that was a very, very, very difficult decision, because of the 
pandemic. I don't know where things are going to. I don't want him to grow up in a 
society where everything is happening from home. I mean, you start imagining it as one 
of these like, post apocalyptic movies where everyone is staying at his own small bubble.  
Health, in general, not only mental but physical health also went worse. I used to go to 
work sometimes I can like spend 30 minutes walking to work, then I get the bus and then 
I continue my way. Now that's gone. Regarding mental health it''s got affected. I mean, I 
usually consider myself as guy with strong mental health. I really wouldn't imagine that 
working from home for two years would affect me emotionally and mentally. But it does. 
First of all, there's a thin line between home life at home and work. And when you're 
working from home this line starts to degrade. Those two concepts converge into one 
 
 
   332 
 
and then you use start missing the time when you have to finish work. At the beginning 
of the pandemic, I sometimes finished work at 9PM, just because I couldn't realize it is 
9pm.  
And after two years, I mean, your colleges turn into icons on your desktop. It's hard to 
realize that this guy I'm talking to is another person he has feelings. I mean, we do talk, 
but if it's online, the talk is not natural. Really, talking with someone o nline, it's not easy. 
Especially if he's a colleague, it's the work if he's not a friend, it's difficult to get involved 
in this social talk.  
During the pandemic, nothing really has changed [in regard to racism]. I mean, still 
stupid people are stupid people, with or without pandemic. I cannot really tell you that 
it has gone up or down. I could say that the inequality got oriented more against 
unvaccinated people than foreign people or darker skinned people. The inequality stop 
being immigrant versus local. They start turning the table against unvaccinated people. 
They really want someone to blame. But as a foreign person, not really. Nothing re ally 
has changed in my life.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,I was deprived of that during lockdown

in social networks, photography and volunteer work in various European projects.  
Pandemic helped my to find my self, to connect with my true self, to understand that I 
am gay. This is also connected with the fact that I began to sit more on TikTok. The 
TikTok, according to algorithms, selects for you people who may be of interest to yo u. I 
got a lot of content about relationships, psychology, as well as LGBT jokes appeared on 
my TikTok , since I have lived as a homophobe all my life. I was very categorical about 
these minorities. Quarantine gave me a chance to return to myself. I spent a  lot of time 
alone '' reading, sitting in social media.  
The more I consumed information, the more I understood that some of my sensations, 
feelings are absolutely normal. And some of these feelings form into an orientation. 
There were just some things in my life that I didn''t pay attention to or didn''t notice t hem, 
but the pandemic and quarantine helped me notice all this, make a revelation, 
conclusions, and also help me realize that they [my previous convictions] are all 
interconnected. I was able to discover my true identity. BEFORE the pandemic, I tried to 
 
 
      
 
build my relationships, but nothing worked out for me. I wondered why? It seemed to 
me that maybe I just haven''t grown up, I have a lot of toxicity, I can''t have healthy 
relationships. In general, it was difficult for me to grasp any feelings for men, although I 
went on dates with them, but nothing worked out for me. I seemed to always mo ve away 
from them all the time. We were constantly breaking up and it seemed to me that I was 
constantly being abandoned. Actually, during the pandemic, I began to notice t his for 
myself. I stood near the bookcase,  and I had a lot of posters with my female idols. And I 
somehow began to think about it, why I had so many such idols. When I began to delve 
into myself, it dawned on me ... It was hard for me to accept this, because I considered 
myself homophobic. But the re are obvious things and facts that say that I like female 
characters and women, but I have never connected with such feelings. I was always told 
that I should get married and have children. And when I first reali zed that I shouldn''t do 
something, it helped me. Since November 2020, I have started this path of acceptance. 
I began to accept and notice the facts about my orientation rather than denying them. I 
recorded all this - my sympathies, obsessions. I didn't co me out, but I let it go and started 
talking about it like it was something ordinary. Then I got TikTok, but I was afraid to make 
some jokes about it, but then I started trying. People began to subscribe to me and there 
was a feeling that I began to enter t he local community [LGBT]. Later, I even went to my 
first Erasmus on the LGBT theme. And yesterday, for the first time, I went to the office of 
the LGBT community in Latvia, which were the first to organize prides. It was my first 
public appearance here an d it was like my coming out, because everyone around 
understands who you are and why you are here. I was received very warmly, almost like 
family. I just realized that from the beginning of quarantine to this day, I have gone a 
giant path of self -acceptanc e. In principle, quarantine helped me in some way, although 
this is strange.  
Only thanks to social networks I was able to find support and my community. I had no 
one to talk to about it. Before I started seeing a therapist, I tried to talk to my friend about 
it, but she said it was temporary. It was painful, we don't talk anymore. When a loved one 
does not accept you or says that this is temporary, it is very unpleasant. It helped me 
understand who my friend is and who is not.  
When the restrictions were lifted, and I realized that it was not yet the time for a 
relationship. I didn't want to give false hopes. I just made friends. There was no 
opportunity to see each other, and even build a trusting relationship. After all, you do n''t 
know who is vaccinated and who isn''t, so you don''t know if you can go somewhere. You 
don''t know if this person developed mental health difficulties during the pandemic. Now 
I feel like I want a healthy relationship!","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",1,I was always told that I should
United States,"""My name is Dasha, I am 25 years old. I do graphic design. I am from Ukraine 
. Now I live in Riga. I moved somewhere at the beginning of December 2021. I have been 
here for more than 3 months. The reason was that I got married in September. And now 
I have done all the paperwork and moved to Riga. Before marriage, I travelled back and 
forth constantly, moved between Zaporozhye and Riga, because there were no ready 
documents and there was no legal reason for me to be here completely. At that time, I 
had a boyfriend in Riga, who is my husband at the moment. And we constantly travelled 
to each other. The pandemic certainly had a big impact, we were not able to sustain our 
relationships like that anymore.  
I think that we would have got married earlier, but there were restrictions on flights, 
restrictions on crossing borders. It was hard to figure out how and where it would be 
best for us to meet, and I think I would have moved to Latvia faster if not for th e 
pandemic.  
When the pandemic just started, that winter [2020] I was in Riga. It turns out right before 
the very first lockdown when they said that they would close the borders, I had to leave 
[Latvia]. I could no longer stay in Riga according to the documents, I had no permit to 
stay.  
It was the most terrible situation that happened to me. I was in Riga and lived here for 
about three months. And then we were sharply told that the borders would be closed, 
and I had 3 days to leave the country. That's when I left Latvia. We got married an d I 
started to do all the necessary paperwork to move to back Latvia.  We got separated 
because of pandemics.  
When I applied for a residence permit, the process was delayed. It turns out that they 
[responsible authorities] did them longer than usual, and now this process is still 
ongoing. We did everything right. We first telephoned and found out everything, how 
everything is going on, how I can apply after marriage in order to register here in order 
 
 
      
 
to receive documents for a residence permit. We were told to collect certain documents 
and bring them [to the office in person].  
As a result, when we collected everything and brought it, they told me that they had not 
accepted documents in person for 2 years since the beginning of the pandemic. I told 
them that the hotline told me that it is possible to come and bring the documents.  It was 
very confusing, since we sign up for appointment two weeks in advance, as we were told 
to do. And no one and any point told us that they [institution] don''t work in person! So, 
it turns out that the process was delayed due to the fact that they do not accept 
documents in person. Everything had to be mailed and done online. It turned out to be 
a very unpleasant situation, it turns out that we were misinformed, and the process 
dragged on.  
I want all the documents and everything necessary to be done already. As a result, it 
turns out that because of the pandemic, everything is delayed, you always need to make 
reservations, it is difficult to get into institutions. You need to sign up in adva nce. I, as an 
alien do not feel support, I don''t feel that institutions are trying to be helpful, they don''t 
change because it is pandemic. I paid for the documents myself, the state duties too, I 
also collected everything myself. Now I have paid one fee, if after a while I have to submit 
something again, I will have to pay again.  
There were other difficulties. I work as a graphic designer. Often businesses are not 
ready to work, they put various business processes on pause, and periodically I 
experienced difficulties with finding work. However, I can't say it had a big impact on 
me. I was fine. I didn't have any problems. The only problem was with the movement, 
well, the flights were closed.","['Workplace', 'Domestic']",0,I experienced difficulties with finding work
United States,"Single woman, age 66, solo self-employed musician/singer, lost all her gigs and 
has started caring for others  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Arita, I am now 66 years old and live alone in a cottage on a 
vacation park in the woods. I am a singer by profession and live from my performances 
and workshops. When the Corona pandemic broke out, all my performances were 
cancelled overnight. From a traveling existence, I was suddenly in my house in the 
woods.  
Because everyone was affected by this pandemic, I wanted to do something for others. 
I was concerned for the people who were stuck inside their houses and in the hospital 
and felt the need to somehow uplift them. Then it occurred to me that I could record and 
send around bird songs. Birds are the symbol of freedom.  
I recorded 35 bird songs. I worked five days a week on these recordings. I had to learn 
the lyrics by heart, find a costume and a background to go with it, and was busy for a day 
per song. When the recording was finished, I sent it around to nursing homes,  friends 
and ac -quaintances, and people who needed it. That's how I kept myself going by 
helping others. I even went on a radio show with my songs. That's something I normally 
never do. It was a unique experience.  
My then partner was supposed to go to Greece for 4 months to take care of vacation 
trips with his Catamaran. But he hadn't even been there a day when everything went 
wrong. He came back to the Netherlands in a hurry and, because he had given up his 
living space, he moved in with me. We lived together for four months and it went 
surprisingly well. He is a cameraman and he made recordings for my bird songs. I also 
realized during that time how different we are.  
Because I live in the middle of nature, I had more time to be in nature and watch nature 
develop. I experienced everything much more intensely I went to meditate by a frog 
pool every day.  
My children and grandchildren did come over but we remained on too sides of a glass 
window. We didn't know what the virus would do. I thought it was a kind of theatre. I put 
mats in the grass and they could sit on them. Some friends came over and sang song s 
for us. All with the glass in between.  
I had no income anymore and was convinced that I would get help from the government 
like many other artists. But I didn't get it. Because I had not earned enough in the period 
before, I could not claim benefits. I could have objected, but then I would have  had to 
gather so much paperwork that I didn't do it. I didn't feel taken seriously as a self -
employed person. I therefore terminated my business.  
That meant that I had to tap into my savings that I had saved for my pension. That is now 
almost gone. I also had to rent out my cottage to have income. That meant that I 
wandered all over the country to stay with others when my cottage was rented out agai n. 
I was all over the country. I always offered something in return yet never had to pay for 
my stay. I also spent some time in the house of a friend for whom I did the gardening 
 
 
   340 
 
and household to make it ready for sale. Unfortunately, during the Corona period, the 
daughter of that acquaintance was very confused and took refuge in that house. 
Suddenly I found myself in a house together with a confused woman. I couldn't really do 
anything and had to take care of her.  
To this day I have almost no gigs. There is still so much uncertainty that it's only a matter 
of time before things start to happen. That's why I got out of the flow of performing. I am 
now more tense before a performance than before. But when I can, I'm s o happy and so 
are others. I'm flexible though, you can't control it anyway.  
All in all, I am a grateful person. I have a house, I can eat and I don't have to worry a lot.

Title: Single mother of two children, one child with disability. Currently burnout. Not 
vaccinated '''because of intuition '' 
 
Narrative : '''My name is Elsa, I live with my two sons aged 11 and 15 in a house in a 
village. My youngest son has an unknown syndrome and has a mental disability. He has 
the mental capacity of a 3 year old. His health is fragile. Because I like to keep him at 
home, I h ave care providers in the house every day. From the early morning until the 
time he goes to bed. Fortunately, he goes to school during the day but when he is ill, he 
stays home.  
I work as a consultant for a large research firm in social issues and I work on domestic 
violence . 
The Corona pandemic suddenly left my children and me at home. I created a workspace 
in the living room. My oldest son had to sit in his room all day in online classes. My 
youngest son was jumping and bouncing around the house, so I needed a care provider 
before lunch and after lunch so I could work. I often had back -to-back meetings online 
and in the meantime was still trying to manage the care providers for my youngest and 
to give my oldest son some structure. I feel I failed in all of that. My oldest son developed 
a game ad -diction and stole money from my account to pay for the games. He did 
nothing at all for school. Fortunately, I found out about it and was able to help him as a 
result.  
I am someone who is used to carrying everything on my shoulders and I did that during 
this entire time. I also kept my youngest son at home because I was worried about his 
fragile health. And I wanted to be a good mother to my oldest child and a good 
couns ellor for work. We had to test a lot because we are not vaccinated. But also because 
of the health condition of my youngest child.  
I was very dependent on the ability of the care providers. That is still true today. Some 
 
 
   341 
 
didn't want to come for fear of getting infected, also because I am not vaccinated. 
Sometimes there was an infection at the school of my youngest so we were stuck at home 
again. The school was suffering from understaffing as well so he could not go there.  
My mother plays a significant role in raising my children. Before the pandemic she would 
travel from Belgium every Thursday taking care of the children. This was no longer 
possible during the first months of the pandemic, my children didn't see her for six  
months and that felt like missing a parent for them. I missed her too. Both as a mother 
but also as a care pro -vider. She does so much for us.  
My father is a medical doctor and he was so angry that I wouldn't get vaccinated that he 
called me a murderer. That was so painful. To this day our contact is limited. I do not 
have to call out for help from him.  
The multitude of crisis like this caused me to develop a burnout. I have been burned out 
for a year now. I have developed heart problems. When I am under too much stress, my 
heart vibrates and rhythm disorders occur.  
I still have a long way to go for my recovery. I am building up slowly but it only takes a 
small thing to go wrong and I am many steps back again. Whether I will ever recover, I 
don't know.  
I have put up a log cabin in the garden to have a place where I can retreat from this over -
crowded life.

Title: Man, 42 years old, Nigerian, solo self -employed artist, married, three kids and no 
support network in the Netherlands  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Ogooluwa, I am 42 years old born and raised in Nigeria. My 
father was a story -teller in Nigeria and that is what I am as well. I came to the Netherlands 
to build a life here. I live with my wife and three children in a big city.  
When the Corona pandemic broke out, all my performances in museums and at the 
schools where I work were cancelled. I was out of a job and out of income overnight.  
Fortunately my wife was still working from home and we were able to live from her 
income.  
I greatly missed my work and the contact with the children I teach. I could only think in 
''open and closed''. The school was closed, the museums were closed, the stores were 
closed in the beginning. Almost nothing was open anymore.  
 
 
   342 
 
At home, suddenly everything was open. We had to work at home, live, teach the 
children at home. I found home enormously noisy and busy all of a sudden. We don't 
live very spaciously so it was constant bustle at home.  
Even though I was and am immensely attached to my work, I could easily let it go.  
One day my wife came home with a new bike for my daughter. I took one look at her old 
bike and saw that I could still fix it up quite well. So I did and sold the old bike. With that 
money I bought another refurbished bicycle and that's how I became a bicyc le mechanic 
in the first Corona period. I absolutely did not want to get any government benefits. I 
don't know if I would have gotten it, but I didn't apply for it. That's always so much red 
tape. I don't like that at all.  
I like reusing old stuff. I'm all for recycling. Refurbishing the old bikes suited me just fine. 
I'll keep doing that. I seem to be good at it and I like it too. I just do that at home. I've 
never done anything other than work in the arts and this has been  a discovery.  
I found it very difficult for the children to be home schooled. They missed their friends. 
We have no real network around us. So we were on our own. One day the children had 
to go to the dentist and my daughter was so happy. She had an outing, she said. 
Normally children really don't like the dentist but on that day in the first lockdown period 
it was an outing. When she said that I was deeply touched. What have we gotten 
ourselves into? I found it a confrontational moment.  
What I also found confronting was that my family in Africa didn't pay any attention to the 
difficult situation we had ended up in. Normally, disasters and misery take place in Africa 
and we are used to then direct our attention and help there. Now it was t he other way 
around. Corona did not affect my family in Africa much and people did not die from it at 
all, while we were here in a frightening situation. They didn't care about us here at all, it 
felt. That was an enormous disappointment to me. There seems  to be little attention paid 
to how we are doing here.  
Up to this point, I have very few performances scheduled. I don't know where I stand. 
People are still very cautious about scheduling performances. I don't want anything to 
happen to make the confidence disappear again, because then I'm out of a job. I'm 
going to let it all go for now and try to trust that there will be opportunities again.  
My faith helps me with that. I know that in the end we will all get through this and learn 
our lessons from this period.

Title: Woman, 86, widow, three adult children, 8 grand children, was hit by car before 
first lockdown. Has never been more scared than during this pandemic  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Annemarie. I am 86 years old and live alone in a detached house 
with a beau -tiful garden.  I am still completely independent. I do everything myself in the 
house.  
A few days before the first lockdown I was hit by a car while driving to the dentist. I was 
hit in the side and fortunately was able to get out of the car on my own. The next day at 
the hospital it turned out that I had broken my upper cervical vertebrae a nd also my 
sternum and a couple of ribs. I was put in a neck collar and allowed to do almost nothing. 
I could also do almost nothing because of the pain. I sat upright on the couch all day and 
slept in a bed downstairs in the room.  
The second time I had to go to the hospital for a check -up, it was deserted. There was 
hardly anyone there. They didn't even want to take a picture of my neck at first because 
of the risk of contagion from the virus. The doctor had to force them to take th at picture.  
From the first day my children came to help me with everything. They stayed for a few 
days and nights and then the next one came to alternate.  
For my oldest daughter the mental stress from the pandemic was too hard and she 
slowly went into psychosis because of all the Corona stress.  
I have been terribly afraid of being infected with the Corona virus. I was at home a lot 
but because I couldn't do anything myself, I had to rely on help. First from my children 
and later from home care. With everyone who came in I worried whether if it wa s safe. 
There is no way to tell who is carrying the virus with them. I felt so vulnerable. Could 
Corona be my end? I love life and for the first time death came into the picture like that.  
I did fortunately have many friends with whom I could talk about this fear. Everyone 
around me had this fear like I had. I had a lot of support from my social network. We 
didn't meet up with many friends at the same time anymore but we did meet up with a 
few. That provided a distraction. Fortunately, I have a large garden where we could sit in 
good weather. This also allowed me to meet my children and grandchildren in safety.  
What I missed most was my dance group and sometimes going to the theatre. I don't 
have that much left because I don't have many social activities anymore. Then the things 
I enjoy are extra important. All that was banned and you have to find a new way of do ing 
your social life. I went out more one on one with friends and went for a walk with the 
neighbour across the street. Every day we walked a bit and we built up the walking to an 
hour.  
Being flexible and adaptable were my most helpful traits. I lived through the war and did 
learn to be able to adapt each time. But despite that, the fear remained. The fear was 
greater than in the war. That has to do with my age. I was a child when I was d etained in 
the Japanese camps in Indonesia. There you could see the danger coming and you 
could take it into account. I was young and could stand it. Now I am older and feel 
vulnerable. I couldn't see the danger either. It was invisible but continuously pr esent. 
You can't contain it and so I feel I lost control more. You can't see the virus but you can 
 
 
   344 
 
see the war.  
What touched me greatly is that a good acquaintance of mine died of Corona after her 
grandson, who was infected, visited her. That grandson felt so guilty. Imagine, it's so nice 
when you as a grandmother can see your grandchildren and suddenly that could b e 
fatal. I thought that was just devastating. Another acquaintance of mine committed 
suicide during the first Corona period. She couldn't handle it. Such intense events do 
stay with you.  
What it has brought me is that I now walk every day with the neighbour across the street 
and that I pay more attention to things in my house. I now have more confidence in the 
future because now they know more about the virus. I hope I will be able to trav el again. 
That's at the top of my list. When you get older, those are some lost years.  
Fortunately, I am an optimistic person. I think that's my strength.

Title: Single mother, 56 lived with her autistic son during 2020/2021, now son livers in 
residential care facility; solo self -employed as mindfulness trainer. Lost many 
assignments and income. Gained more peace of mind both for her son and for herself.  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Edith. I am 56 years old and until recently lived with my youngest 
son who has autism. I am (solo)self -employed and have a practice as a trainer and coach 
in Mindfulness. I live in the city centre. I have no car and do everything by bike. Before  
the pandemic I was often on the road for work. My son was at school then and during 
the day we would see each other very little. In the evening we were usually tired and 
hardly spoke to each other. When the pandemic started, my son and I sudde nly found 
ourselves at home from school and work. In the beginning there was no online 
education. I did work online pretty quickly but a lot of work also fell away. We came to a 
standstill, so to speak. I was home more than ever and that gave me peace.  
Every afternoon my son and I would go for a walk. He was 18 years at the time and just 
at an age when was willing to join for a stroll. Now he would never think of it anymore. 
During the afternoon walks, we had long conversations with each other for the fi rst time 
in ages. During those conversations, my son really acknowledged for the first time that 
he has autism and how much he is affected by it. He often falls silent and has problems 
 
 
   345 
 
with compulsions, he is over -stimulated easily. Only because of the lockdown we 
discovered this. For the first time he was open for help.  
During that period at home nothing came out of his hands. When the online lessons 
started, he could hardly concentrate. I also found it difficult to concentrate for work. 
Everything felt as a burden and working from home made me extremely aware of this. 
My son was home and present all day. Sometimes he would stand by the fridge for 1.5 
hours making a sand -wich or he would sit on the couch endlessly busy with his phone. 
With a lot of trial and error, he graduated his secondary education in the first year of the 
pandemic. Don't ask me how because he didn't do anything for it. But because he 
attends special education and they had extra leniency with the students there, he still 
passed the exams. After that he wanted to go to a higher education but because all 
education was online it all came to a dead end after a month.  
Then we went into the trajectory of admission for a resident home. It costs me a lot of 
energy at home to guide him and there was no other way out but to admit him for a 
residential home. Fortunately, a spot became available in a special clinic. At first t his 
demanded a lot from me but when things went well I could finally let go of the care. My 
son is now in a supported living project and works in a lunch café for people with 
disabilities.  
During the Corona period I discovered how important it was for young people to be 
able to reflect on themselves and everything that is happening around them. Now I 
provide mindfulness training in schools and online to young people who need it. I also 
start ed to re -think my work and my business relations. I stopped working for my biggest 
clients because I found the pressure too high and the path they wanted to take didn't 
match my purpose in work.  
I also needed to recover from the intensive covid period with my son. I'm now taking 
some time for myself and considering possibilities and opportunities for my future. Both 
privately and in my work. I am now coming home to myself.  
I have lost my faith in politics in recent times. I deliberately did not get vaccinated. I am 
so angry at the government forcing young people in particular to get vaccinated for a 
QR code so they can do fun things. That confidence is not going to come back  overnight. 
But despite that, I look back on an intense but valuable time.

and he were getting caught up in the urgency of the requests for help and the risk

contagion at work.  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Erik, I am 48 years old and I am the co -founder and director of a 
large region -wide organization in specialized youth care.  
The Covid -19 period has had a tremendous impact on me, my staff, and the children, 
youth and families we serve.  
During the first lockdown we saw the most immediate effects. There was fear, insecurity 
and a lack of perspective.  Both the young people and their parents were suddenly in a 
new reality that no one was prepared for.  
As social workers, we had a big question: how do we stay in touch with this vulnerable 
tar-get group? Our work thrives on personal contact. When we see and hear what is 
happening in a family, we can make interventions. Then, with lockdown measures 
imposed,  we only got part of the information and we could not always assess what was 
needed.  
We saw three groups emerge in the lockdown. The first was a group of youth who thrived 
just fine in isolation. These were often youth with autistic spectrum disorders or social 
anxiety disorders. Their world was suddenly a lot clearer.  
The second group consisted of young people and also parents who had to adapt to a 
new situation and had difficulty doing so. They had to give up their autonomous way of 
life and that caused problems. This caused internal tensions and tension in the domesti c 
sphere. They became depressed, started gaming more, school came last. Parents had 
their hands in their pockets and could do very little because there were so many 
restrictions.  
Then there was a group of families with whom there was already a lot going on before 
the Corona pandemic hit. They were under even more pressure. Here, for example, the 
violence and aggression increased and addictions grew. This happened to families in 
various parts of society. But you could see that with families with smaller housing, even 
more stress was created.  
That marked the beginning of the quest for us to keep in touch. We met with young 
people online and outside. And in the third group of families, with a careful testing 
policy, we still visited. The heart of our work is that we operate in the social context  of 
the family. We had no choice in our feelings than to take risks for the well -being of our 
clients. Fortunately, we were able to keep our youth drop -in center open. These are the 
most vulnerable young people who would not make it without this structure and days 
with us. Before you know it, they end up in the clinical circuit.  
And of course we were not able to guide all young people and parents equally well be -
cause of the restrictions and measures. This means that now that society opened up 
again, we give extra attention to those young people who need our help more than ever. 
You can see that the Corona period has led to more requests for help and that new 
complaints have arisen among children and young people. Think of mood problems and 
gloominess, eating problems, anxiety disorders and social isolation. We are now 
developing n ew services for them.  
What I missed enormously during this period is the involvement of the municipality in 
our implementation tasks. At the beginning of the Corona crisis, there was a weekly letter 
from the municipality to check on how the assistance was going and whether anyt hing

needed attention. Now that we are coping with the damage of the crisis, we hear 
nothing. While there are now more problems in children and families than ever.  
I am also afraid that now that everything is opening up again, young people will want to 
catch up on what they missed out on and will also start smoking, drinking, partying etc.

Title: Singing teacher, lived with her husband who became leader of an anti -vaccine 
group, could no longer give live lessons and has turned to all online opportunities to 
sing and teach together. Collapsed completely after the first lockdown, marriage ended.  
 
Narrative : '''My name is Olga, I am 59 years old and until a few months ago lived together 
with my '' now ex - husband in a village near medium -large city. I work as a singing 
teacher and am the conductor of a number of choirs and ensembles.  
When the Covid -19 restrictions and measures took effect I could no longer do my job. 
Sing -ing was almost immediately blacklisted as a risk of infection and all my lessons and 
choir rehearsals were stopped. I immediately panicked. I love my work but I also have to 
live from it. In the silence of everything that disappeared, I felt the storm brewing in my 
head. How was I going to give lessons? How was I going to provide myself an income? 
And how could I keep in touch with my students and my choirs and ensembl es? I delved 
frenetically into all the online possibilities that existed. Thanks to my extensive network, 
a lot of things turned out to be available.  
My ex -partner had absolutely no eye for my situation and didn't support me. Not 
financially but not mentally either. He was only trying to unravel and distribute Corona 
conspiracy theories.  
Within a few weeks, I was teaching online from a room at home. The singing lessons; the 
ensembles and the choirs. I made a huge investment in equipment to build a kind of 
digital studio and create optimal sound. It was my only chance to teach but I hated i t. I 
was run -ning 70 hours a week to make sure everything ran smoothly. They were 
complicated pro -grams and I studied endlessly. Despite all the hours I worked, I lost a 
third of my income, which is not very high anyway.  
Meanwhile, my partner became more and more entangled in the web of conspiracy 
thoughts. He constantly bombarded me with his latest insights and was also angry and 
 
 
   348 
 
grim all day because he saw the Covid period as an ultimate act of dictatorship. The virus 
had been created in a laboratory to wipe us out and inject chips via vaccines so that we 
would function like robots. At first I tried to listen to it and put it aside but as the first 
vaccination programs emerged it became more grim.  
As a singing teacher, I was eager to be vaccinated so that I could do my job again when 
society opened up. But my partner was devilish about that idea. When I would get vacci -
nated I would have to leave home and he would have to divorce me. My back was aga inst 
the wall. From him I would get no help to survive financially. And if I didn't get vac -
cinated, I wouldn't be able to teach in the time it would take to go live again.  
I had continuous pain in my heart and felt like he had put a knife to my throat.  
By the time summer vacation came around and there was some peace and quiet, I was 
completely exhausted. I was shaking all day. I couldn't rest either because at home the 
tension kept building up.  
In the meantime I have been separated because I decided to get myself vaccinated.  
I am now coming to rest a little. I am furious with a government that has absolutely no 
compassion and attention for artists. I received no financial support while I bitterly 
needed it. They just left us out in the cold. If I had had support I wouldn't hav e to work 
70-hour weeks to make ends meet.

In the past, as a singing teacher, I was always looked upon with admiration. When singing

isolate herself completely to avoid being infected or else no caregivers could come. 
Beca me severely  depressed by the isolation.

When the Covid -19 pandemic broke out, I immediately isolated myself. Many people 
think that I have fragile health and would not survive such an infection. But that is actually 
not true. My health is good but I am 100% dependent on care throughout the day. If I 
were to get infected, no caregivers could come to me to help me and then I c an't do 
anything. I can't take care of myself or eat or drink.... For that reason, I was so careful.  
I am someone who has a great need for social contact and I have a lot of contacts. But I 
couldn't see anyone anymore. I also had to work at home and didn't see anyone during 
the day or at night except the people who were taking care of me.  
When that lasted longer I became depressed. I can't do without people around me at 
all. I felt so lonely. And there was so little perspective.  
It wasn't until the summer of 2020 that I was able to meet my friends again. In the 
following year, I went to choir rehearsals for the first time. From the summer of 2021, I 
felt freer again and could be in the middle of society again. As a result, I felt happier and 
my life became full and rich.  
I do have to say that working from home gave me a tremendous amount of peace. At 
work it is often busy and then I can't concentrate well. I became more productive by 
work -ing from home and things went better for me. I really liked that. At the beginning 
of the Corona period I was still on a temporary contract. I was uncertain about the 
contract extension because there was so much ambiguity because of working from 
home about how they evaluated me as an employee. Furthermore, I couldn't ask 
questions when I c ouldn't work something out. Before, you could just go and talk to a 
colleague in the hallway but that possibility had disappeared with working from home.

Poland,"''My name is Alicja and I am 45 years old. I live in a city in the north of Poland , 
with female partner and my 14 years old son. My son was diagnosed with Asperger''s 
Syndrome. I am full time activist. I work in LGBTQ NGO. My income consists of my son''s 
allowance.  
I consider worsening my mental condition as a main effect of the pandemic''s lockdown. 
In December 2019 I was diagnosed with depression, in March 2020 the pandemic 
started and, even though I was taking drugs, my well -being has worsened . It is 
connected to being isolated from people. I am extraverted person and I need social 
contacts to live. Moreover, at the beginning of the pandemic I was living with my son and 
two trans people who were in homelessness crisis. One had dissociative diso rder, the 
other had depression and alcohol problem. We were four mentally ill people on 56 
square meters, in my apartment. We were all pulling each other down. I was single then 
and I didn''t have anyone to talk to. Because of the lockdown my all activities  had to be 
suspended. We tried to do some meetings of support groups online but it didn''t work. 
Less and less people were attending them. I was also making a movie when the 
pandemic started. At the beginning of April 2020,  I should have shot some scenes for 
the movie but because of the governmental restrictions we were able to come back to 
the movie one year later. And then, last year (2021), I was already preoccupied mentally 
with new projects. Lockdown meant closing of sc hools and my son was at home. He h as 
a lot of energy, constantly talks about something. So focusing on intellectual work with 
him was very hard. He didn''t have online classes, because he attends a democratic 
school and they didn''t provide pupils with online teaching. It lasted 3 months. Be cause 
we live at the attic we could explore our roof and other roofs of our building. We couldn''t 
go out because of the governmental restrictions on free movement, also my son felt 
uncomfortable wearing a mask. So we started going to the roof. Our neighbor s were 
making comments on that. Pandemic has also changed my whole life as an activist. I was 
in constant move, going to equality marches or organizing them. I was also very active 
socially, meet my friends, party with them. And now it is all gone. I don''t  feel this need to 
meet them, party anymore. I was tired. And until now I haven''t come back to that life. 
 
 
      
 
One of my friends came to live a while with me, because he had online learning. We 
watched a lot of Netflix series. Later my son came back to school, in a rotation mode. It 
was good because there was a big garden and a fountain made especially for him. 
Because of the hygienic restrictions all fountains in the city were closed which upset  my 
son very much. At that time I was very depressed. I even had thoughts to become vaccine 
tester so either I die or I benefit mankind and the pandemic ends faster. I wante d to 
come back to normal life. We didn''t organize any equality march in 2020. But we 
organized the Abortion March, here in Szczecin, in October 2021. Considering fears of 
loosing a job or income, I didn''t have them. My son''s father lost his income as an ar tist. 
But we managed. We had a lot of food supplies at home.  
Regarding my work in NGOs and with queer youth the period of the pandemic was ''not 
cool at all''. According to restrictions on free movement and total lockdown queer people 
were trapped in their houses either with violent parents or not accepting them for w ho 
they are. This queer youth didn''t have a chance to meet their partners. Online support 
groups didn''t work out because of this situation. It was hard for those people to talk with 
somebody about their problems when their parents would hear everything fro m the 
other room. Pandemic has also destroyed our volunteers'' network. Without social 
contacts and engagement in actions we lost almost all of the volunteers.  But the queer 
youth suffered the most. We have noticed an increase in the number of suicides in 2021 
and in needs for psychological support. Being closed at home, having no privacy and 
reluctance of some psychotherapists to work online have diminished our ability to act in 
this field. In June 2020 we started meeting people in need on my roof. Of cour se, only 
some of the people from our previously formed support group were able to come, some 
were not allowed by parents. Some youth were kicked out of the house or run away. One 
boy lived with me for a week. Other person lived with me for 10 months. It wa s a trans 
person who was not accepted by parents. I also fed this person. I also opened my doors 
to another person, underage, who finally was taken away from me by they mother.   
My son didn''t want to go out because of the obligation to cover mouth and nose. But 
always somebody was at home when I had to leave so he never stayed alone. The 
pandemic had also other side -effects on my son. My son asked me about different things 
concern ing the pandemic. But after some time my son started meeting his grandmother 
who said him the opposite things. For him it was very stressful that two important persons 
in his life talk different things on the same topic. He called this state '''confusion ''. Once 
he said that the most problematic in the pandemic was not seeing his father for a longer 
period, ''confusion'', lack of working fountains in the city, obligation to wear a mask and 
no school.       
 I am vaccinated. I took three doses. My son and partner as well. I trust science. Travelling, 
which is very important part of my and my son''s life, is easier when having a Covid -
passport. '''","['Domestic', 'Education']",0,"depression, in March 2020 the pandemic started"
United States,"''My name is Julia and I am 46-years -old women, teacher of math and director 
of the elementary school. I have a husband and two daughters '' 22 and 16 years old.  
The pandemic has for sure impacted my health. Due to the fact that I have a thrombosis 
I couldn't get vaccinated at the same date in February 2021 as other teachers, but I had 
to wait for a specific vaccine. Then, in May when I could done it I have to wait  my turn. 
This long waiting caused my fear of being infected. And then what? I am among 600 
other people '' pupils and staff. I was scared the most about the kids. That was stressful 
situation. Of course, we had to stick to the Ministerial restrictions of m easuring body 
temperature, cleaning hands, wearing masks but it is not all so simple to do in school. 
Different situations happen and then you don''t think about cleaning your hands or 
putting a mask on your mouth. Moreover, wearing a mask all the time is v ery tiring.  
Considering my professional life I would say that our school wasn''t prepared for such a 
big change '' online teaching. It was a surprise for us. We lacked computer equipment 
 
 
      
 
and online platform we could use to perform classes. Lack of equipment was the biggest 
problem especially from March 2020 to June 2020. But I was in school - as its director - 
quite often and therefor I had a possibility to get infected by the virus. And it happened. 
In November 2020 I had a coronavirus. My thrombosis didn''t help here. I was  feeling 
very weak, couldn''t eat, just drink. That fatal state lasted for 2 or 3 days. But when I 
recovered few days later I get back to work right away. There were thin gs that couldn''t 
wait longer. In my home we all had coronavirus. My husband had a serious cough and 
our daughter had flu -like symptoms. In 2021 I get vaccinated. I was very happy that finally 
I could do it. Comparing 2020 and 2021 I must say that in 2020 m ore adults/teachers 
and staff were infected by the virus, but when this trend was opposite in 2021 I was happy 
I could be vaccinated as soon as possible. I put a lot of effort into organizing distance 
and stationary learning. It was logistically hard, espe cially when we were obliged to 
change the hours of functioning of some of school''s departments (for instance library) 
or services (meals for pupils). I consider year 2021 better or different comparing to 2020. 
As I said I could be vaccinated, adults and ki ds that were sick with the virus gained natural 
immunity so for instance teachers were more available. I didn''t force anyone to get 
vaccinated, it was everyone''s individual decision. Due to the governmental hygienic 
restrictions we were obliged to change s chool regulations, change of working hours of 
our departments. Because of that we had a lot of paperwork. Everyone at our school is 
obliged to wear a mask. But there are few exceptions like children with Asperger''s 
Syndrome and some children who due to som e chronic diseases can''t wear it. Of course 
there are also children whose parents do not believe in the virus. Sometimes we had to 
argue with them. Masks cause a lot of misunderstandings. I can also see the change in 
people''s behavior. They are now more ne rvous and stressed than before the pandemic. 
They have more fears and are more careful.  
When it comes to pupils and remote learning I would say distance learning gave them a 
hard time. For some children the whole situation with online teaching was stressful. They 
didn''t want to turn on their cameras or take part in the lessons. We have childr en who 
logged in to the system but we couldn''t be sure if they were there if they didn''t speak at 
all or show their faces. Other children turned off their cameras, lied about problems with 
computer equipment '' camera or microphone '' to not attend online cl asses. It means 
that we need to spend now more time to see if we taught them what we wanted. We 
have to check if remote learning brought effects. The other aspect I see as a 
consequence of the closure of school due to the pandemic is that kids has also cha nged. 
They need peers in daily life to develop properly. After summer break in the first year of 
the pandemic we organized some integration events for our pupils so they could get 
used to each other and ease themselves from computers, especially when we di dn''t 
know what will happen next '' remote classes again or stationary learning. I can see that 
remote learning affects children not only physically '' they are more tired '' but also affects 
their knowledge and acquired skills. They have also become more mali gnant towards 
each other. They learned how to hurt somebody by using computer. School''s 
psychologist and pedagogist all the time have new reports from parents with their 
children problems. They ask them for help. Their children start having depression. We 
already have few pupils who due to depression have individual teaching and started 
psychotherapy. When it comes to teaching platform and computer equipment due to 
 
 
   373 
 
the lack of both of them, when government closed schools we firstly contacted pupils 
and parents by electronic diary. We sent them explanation of the material and some 
homework to do. We also dedicated a lot of time for consultations '' in groups and 
individual '' so we were sure that our pupils get proper knowledge. Of course due to 
differe nt life circumstances '' sickness of a teacher or some pupils '' it took much more 
time than anticipated. Considering school''s computer equipment, as I mentioned we 
lacked i t. We took part in governmental project ''Digital School'' twice. Received laptops 
and tablets were used by both '' children and teachers. When parents report a need of a 
computer we signed with them an agreement. But we didn''t have enough computers for 
all c hildren. There were families with four children and only one computer. How they 
were supposed to learn something if they didn''t have their own tools for learning? I put 
also a lot of effort in organizing trainings for teachers, pupils and parents to famili arize 
them with learning platform and other tools we use in teaching process. In October 2020 
everyone was ready for remote learning/teaching.  
We can''t forgot about children with special educational needs. We have 43 of them in 
our school. They have a right to remote learning provided in school. That meant also a 
necessity of having laptops and teachers on site. Classes for some of those pupil ha s to 
be shortened to 30 minutes. Teachers also had to replace each other because some of 
them were sick, some have contract for only 20 hours of supporting the learning process 
a week. As I mentioned before it was hard logistically to manage. Of course we also had 
children whose parents didn''t have proper condition for their child to learn from home. 
Then we accepted that child and we also had to organize care and place for them. 
Sometimes there were situations when one teacher look after them in different 
classrooms.  
Getting back to my infection with coronavirus and my work. I didn''t have time to rest 
after the illness. I had to get back to work. Firstly, for a first two days after my sick leave I 
worked from home, then prepared myself during the weekend for working on  site and 
get back to it very fast. I must say that after one and a half year of being infected I have 
not yet recovered fully. I feel different and more stressed now. As an effect of 
governmental restrictions we had a lot of paperwork. We had to change a lot of internal 
regulations, prepare and sing agreements with parents for computer equipment rental. 
We were obliged to check people''s body temperature, make lists of people who entered 
the building. Papers and papers. A lot of data to be properly archived .  
I forgot to mention that internet access was also problematic. We had this problem as a 
school. When much more people work online then everything works slower or stops 
working. But it was more problematic for families. They had radio internet or with data 
limit. Sometimes it caused situations that children couldn''t attend classes because they 
didn''t have internet access at home. Now I can see that it has changed. Parents use their 
''500+'' child benefit to buy computer equipment to their children or upgrade t heir 
internet connection. ''","['Education', 'Domestic']",3,"I was feeling very weak, couldn''t eat,"
United States,"I live in a small village in the inner country , I''m married and mother of two. I 
own a mini market in the village. My major memory of the beginning of the pandemic 
was of the fear. Of people around me and also myself. Fear of the unknown. Me and my 
husband never went home. I needed to keep the shop op en, it was na essential activity. 
My husband also needed to maintain  working but the was able to combine online 
working with in presence working at the company. He is the manager being responsible 
for a lot of processes,  so it was important that he went there every day. The company 
never closed. I remember  so well of people being afraid of everything. Washing all and 
afraid of touching, afraid of being close to other people. At my shop was complicated, I 
changed all the procedures. During the first confinement I had a big raise in the number 
of costumers. A  lot of people coming and saying that they felt safer  in buying in a small 
shop than in the bigger supermarkets. I already had an informal delivery service for older 
people or people with mobility problems in the village. But during the first confi nement 
the request for home delivery raised tremendously. I suddenly had new clients from 
outside the village, even from the cities, that wanted me to take the products to their 
home. People were very stressed. And still are, I believe. People sometimes don'' t 
understand the rules imposed by the health authorities and get upset for some of the 
rules, for example not touching some products and therefore not bei ng able to choose 
what the pieces they want. I also had some problems with people wanting to enter in the 
shop and even entering despite the rule fixed at the door of a limited number of clients 
inside the shop. It''s been tiring dealing with all this. With  my family the worst part was 
with kids and the schooling. My son was in primary school and had home schooling but 
my small girl was at the pre school and still is so she stayed home without any kind of 
activity. And I couldn''t stay with them. None of us a sked for the family assistance license, 
we couldn''t. What we did was to adapt our schedules to provide them support the 
maximum that we could. My husband went to work much earlier in the morning when I 
was still home. Then he returned at 10 am and stayed w orking online until lunch time, 
when I close the shop and come home until 4 pm. During that period I did a longer luch 
break, ususally I open at 3.30 pm but during the confinement periods I only opened after 
4 pm, people knew because I put a lettering in t he door. Also people did not come so 
often, they tended to do shopping less then they did before the pandemic. My husband 
tryed to return home as soon as he could but sometimes my kids needed to stay a little 
bit alone. Also my father lives next doo so he took a look on them. But it wew difficult 
times because usually they were here in the shop with me at the end of the afternoon 
and in that time they couldn''t. Finantially we had no problems. As I told before, the 
pandemic even made me sell more, especially  in the first phase. In 2021 the sales were 
more close to what it was before. So we didn't suffered Money dificulties due to the 
pandemic. And as we never went home, we didn''t had the isolation effect some people 
told me they were having. The old people th at come to the shop suffered much. They 
 
 
   376 
 
were afraid of dying and were home alone without anyone to talk to. Coming to the shop 
and meeting neighboors is very important to them, my shop is a little a meeting point 
here in the village. I also like talking to them, mostly the old ladies, listening to their 
problems and so.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",1,Also my father lives next doo so
Canada,"I am Victor, I''m 61 years old and I''m a single man with an innate physical 
handicap. When the pandemic started I was living in Lisbon in my flat and was 
unemployed.  I decided to come to my home village because I didn''t felt safe at Lisbon 
moving by public  transports and living in a flat. Here I have my car and I live in a house 
with space outside and have a small garden.  At the begi nning I came just for a while but 
then the pandemic didn''t pass and now I am living here for 2 years now. I''m starting to 
consider the idea  of selling or renting my flat at Lisbon now. The pandemic made my 
totally change my life. In Lisbon I had several friends and was considering joining a 
biological agriculture project. At weekends I used to go to the cinema or theatre. Now I 
live a very di fferent life in the village. I also have a lot of friends here but their interests 
are very different from mine and due to the pandemics I spent much more time at home. 
I dedicate a lot of time to my garden, to cultivating the land and cookin g. All my siblings  
are emigrated in Canada. Since the pandemic they haven''t visit anymore, we just talk by 
phone and internet. I like living here but I miss part of the lifestyle I had in Lisbon. Here 
everybody  knows each other and being a single man I can''t go out often with the same 
woman friends without starting rumours  that we are dating. At the same time most of my 
woman friends who are alone are too occupied with their kids. So I have less company 
here to go for a walk. And  there is scarce cultural of fer. But to go back to Lisbon its no 
option to me until it is considered completely safe in terms of health. Now I am waiting 
to see how things evolute. There are a lot of plans I had to this decade of my life, things 
that I do now or I won''t do any longer like getting a caravan and travel. If the pandemics 
continues I need to decide what to do with my life.","['Public Space', 'Identity']",0,I am waiting to see how things
United States,"I am a 45 years old married woman, mother of 2 girls. I live in a medium  size 
city in the coast, near Lisbon. I have a degree in environmental engineering but I have 
worked in several jobs until now, most of them not connected with the area. When the 
pandemic started I first did not believe  in it. I was joking with my husband who was 
following the situation since the end of 2019, saying he was sort of paranoic. Then 
suddenly it became absolutely notorious everything was quite serious and concerni ng. 
Still I must say that 2020 was not a bad year for us as a family. During confinement we 
even had a great time together . Both me and my husband were able to adapt to online 
working but as commercials with several companies closing we had much less work to 
do. Less work and no concerns of loosing income, we had much more time for our girls 
so we did a lot of things together  at home like cooking, playing, having fun together  We 
talked about things we never had time before. In my building we are just 5 fami lies living 
there and one has a supermarket so we organized as a group to do shopping lists and 
this couple brought the groceries  to each flat. IN the second confinement this didn''t 
happened. I believe that in the first confinement  people were solida l and showed their  
best. In the second people were very tired and was completely different. The worst part 
was social life and social distanciation from people. I do believe it is a terrible thing and 
presently from my point of view there is no reason at all for maintaining this kind of rules. 
I have a very close relation with my parents and my two sisters. Also with my partner 
mother and his sister. So it was very difficult to being apart. That first Christmas, we 
stayed a part and it was terrible. The last one we didn''t sta yed, we were together  And 
you know the thing was in the Christmas of 2020 we stayed apart and were afraid that 
the kids could infect my parents. All the 3 of us, me and my sisters were afraid of this. 
Then in January 2021 we wanted that the kids saw their grandparents so we vi sited them. 
My father was already infected but he didn''t knew so all of us got Covid. It was bad 
because all of us had symptoms but my father and my mother got worse and my father 
was intubated. It was terrible those days, without know ing how he was, without seeing 
him. And then later that year I got sick. Iwas already sick, with symptoms long time ago 
but I didn''t pay attention. IN 2021 things got real worse and I ended up in hospital, doing 
two operations in two days and in the second  I really thought I was going to die, I was so 
weak. The pandemic worsen everything. Not in terms of attendance from doctors, when 
I was attended it was quite good. But exams took longer and then when I was in the 
hospital not being allowed to see anybody was terrible. I could only thing '''I''m going to 
die, what is going to happen to my daughters?'' My partner one day said in the hospital: 
Do whatever you like but I won''t leave here today without seeing my wife. Ans he saw 
me and it was really  important to see him. Then all the time after coming home, it was a 
long recovery process, during that time I thought a lor about life. I changed job. I moved 
to a new job where I have more time to me and my family.",['Domestic'],0,I was joking with my husband who

a medium size city in the coast close to Lisbon. have a chronic disease which got worse 
during this pandemic period. Presently I live with my husband, my mother -in-law who is 
in her nineties and our dog.  
The pandemic brought fear and distance to our li ves. It was very disturbing knowing that 
a lot of people were dying and knowing people that died. At the same time being afraid 
of situations w here people don''t take care and living in a big building  with a lot of joint 
owners, being obliged to meet a lot of people daily. I am administrator of the 
condominium  and recently I had to call the attention of one person that keeps not using 
the mask inside the building and in the elevators which upsets the others. We have in 
the building a lady who lost both her husba nd and son in law for the Covid, for her is 
being very difficult to overcome it and crossing with someone that doesn't respect the 
rules is very disturbing. In January 2021 before vaccination me and all people at my 
home got Covid. We also conta minated the family of my older daughter. Me and my 
husband got worst, my m mother -in-lawwas asymptomatic . I had terrible diarreha for two 
weeks. My husband went to the hospital as he was with lack of oxygen. I stayed here at 
home for 2 weeks, very sick, without talkin g with him because when he was i intubated, he 
was unconscious  and having to care for my m mother -in-lawdespite having no forces. It 
was really difficult , my support was my younger daughter who came several times a day 
bringing supplies and leaving it at the entrance and walking the dog. Thanks to her I 
never needed to ask for more help. It was terrible feeling so sick and concerned with him 
and still havi ng to make the meals to my m mother -in-law She was fine but she is not used 
to do nothing. She lives with u s for 9 years now and she doesn't help with the house, she 
behaves like a visit. And during that period was the same.  
One other thing that upset me much with Covid was missing my granddaughters from 
my older daughters. Usually they stay here after school while their parents are working. 
One of them, the older even has lunch here everyday because she attends the school of 
the neighbourhood . In the confinement periods I missed very much them. We are a very 
close family, us with our three daughters, their partners and all the grandchildren. Being 
away from them and not being able to help my daughters with their daily needs wa s very 
difficult. Then when my older daughter got sick (not Covid) and need to be operated 
and suffered life risk, all the dista ncing  rules were really difficult and made us suffer very 
much. She was unconscious so we couldn't speak to her. Fortunately  that we knew 
someone working at the hospital as a nurse so we got more information that is usual.  
Now that we are vaccinated I feel more safe. But I keep staying much at home. Actually I 
already was a very homely person before Covid. I feel good at my home, I don''t 
understand why people go out just to shop windows or to show themselves. It is true 
that for my health I should walk  more. But walking causes me pain so all this together

Brazil,"''I''m a 19 years old student. I used to live in Brazil but we moved to Portugal 
in December 2020 for several reasons and also due to Covid. I live with my parents and 
my 13 years old brother at a small city in the inner country.  When the pandemic started 
I was beginning my second year of high school and I was enjoying much. I attended a 
Waldorf school so each year has a different structure. The second year of high school is 
the more reflexive. I was enjoying  much all the disciplines, specially the artistic on es. I 
was learning how to cut the rock. The in the 15th of March the schools closed all and we 
came home. I never returned to school again while at Brazil. Schools didn''t reopened 
more. I had classes online. We were afraid in that time, when my father went  to the 
supermarket it seemed like a war I remember  he returning and taking all his cloth, it was 
impressive. All that environment plus being always at home  made me feel depressed, it 
was quite difficult to be always home. Then in December we emigrate to P ortugal. When 
my parents told me we were coming here for this region and will live in a small city at 
first I was upset. I couldn''t see me living in a small place, I considered myself a big city 
person. But After all  I enjoyed very much and now I don''t see me living in Brazil again. 
When we arrived is was almost Christmas vacations at school so I only went to school in 
January 2021. I attended school in presence for 3 weeks and then all closed again. I 
immediately  liked the school, the teachers and the clas s. So it was bad coming home. 
But contrary to what have happened in Brazil here online classes were very good. 
Comparing the two periods, I think that my school at Brazil in 2020 wasn''t able to adapt 
weel and this school here was much better doing it in 20 21. Besides having the classes 
with the rest of my class, I had extra classes with the teachers, Support classes just for 
myself to help my integration. Also my colleagues  were worried with me and started to 
send me messages, knowing that I didn''t knew any one. I now have very close friends in 
my class, I''m quite happy. Three other girls started to discuss the contents with me and 
we formed a study group still while in online school. This  year is running smoothly. I feel 
very adapted, I had the Covid vaccin e and I feel that things are almost normal now, 
except for the masks that are quite a nnoying. I believe the health measures that the 
Portuguese State has taken were quite adequate. It might have been an exaggeration  to 
reopen the nightclubs so early. But n ow I believe that the right measures are being taken.","['Education', 'Domestic']",4,"I feel very adapted, I had the"
United States,"''I am a 49 -year -old divorced woman with two teenage children. I used to 
have a small distribution business with my husband. I was very active, I only stayed home 
when I gave birth to my children and a couple of months afterward. The business had 
me spend m uch time driving. I would spend hundreds of kilometres  driving, even while 
I was pregnant, which, according to the doctors, most likely affected my back and legs 
and left me with chronic pain. I also have a heart condition which is not diagnosed 
clearly. After the divorce I have worked for a while with my sis ter and then I was 
unemployed. This issue with my back and legs prevents me from standing up or sitting 
for too long and a hernia, which prevents me from lifting weights. For this reason, I had 
to quit my job in January 2020 and then right away the pandemi c started. I started to 
work temporarily as a sales assistant in the shop of a family friend. He used to be a friend 
of my ex -husband''s. I go to work daily, but do not work regular hours, depending of what 
is needed that day. He is not very committed about  paying me, so there is always the risk 
of not getting paid in one month. Now, for example, my salary is two weeks late. His 
business has been struggling since the pandemic started, sales are down. The shop sells 
mainly Turkish sweets and confectionery, so  the business depended on the fairs and 
 
 
      
 
festivals, such as the Christmas Market and others.  
I was very lucky during the pandemic to find support with my landlord. He did not ask 
for rent for three months in the first year of the pandemic. Last year he also cut down the 
price of rent in order to help me get by.  
Because of my health conditions I cannot find a proper job now, as most jobs that I am 
qualified for, in the retail sector, require standing up for long periods of time. My age is 
also an impediment in the search for jobs. Once you are passed 45 years old and have 
some health issues on the side, it becomes a lot more difficult to find a job and to be 
able to cope. I should have made more medical investigations for my back pains, but 
you know how us women are, we tend to neglect these health -related concerns  when it 
comes to ourselves.  
My husband emigrated to Sweden six years ago. We divorced eleven years ago but he 
does not pay child support or alimony. He always claims that he struggles with money. I 
chose not to take legal action because of the children. I do not want them to see thei r 
parents fight. I try to encourage them to have a good relation with their father.  
I sometimes apply for social welfare. I do not do it often; I am quite embarrassed to do 
it. I am trying to gather up the courage to reapply now, because I am much behind on 
my utilities and administration bills.  
I tried to shield my children from the pandemic''s effects. I am really proud of how they 
cope. Even at 16 and 18 respectively, they started to earn their own pocket money. My 
son has a scholarship and my daughter is saving to buy tools to become a tattoo a rtist. 
Online schooling was a struggle for them, because they had to study on their phones. 
Our laptop had broken down before the pandemic started and we could not afford a 
new one. They are very good children, but my heart sinks to see them confronted wit h 
financial worries. My daughter, for example, likes to eat fruit and vegetables and there 
are moments when I just cannot afford to buy her fresh produce. Just last evening we 
were shopping for groceries together and she wanted cauliflower, broccoli and sw eet 
potatoes. I chose a small cauliflower head and weighted it and it cost more than the 
equivalent of 3 euros. I just could not afford it.  
I dream of opening my own small business, but I cannot raise the money. I would need 
around 5000 euros.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,them to see thei r parents fight
United States,"I am an 80 -year -old widowed and retired man, who used to work as an upper 
secondary school teacher in natural sciences. I live by myself in a midsized Swedish city: 
in the same house that my late wife and I moved to 50 years ago. I have three grown -up 
children and several grandchildren. We see each other often and I am very happy to 
have them. During the pandemic, I have not stopped seeing my family at all. Instead, we 
started seeing each other outdoors to a larger extent than we had done before '' 
especiall y before the vaccine came. Seeing each other outdoors, even in the winter, went 
just fine, and neither me nor my children have had Covid yet. We even arranged a 50th 
anniversary party which was held solely outdoors. Me and my family ''have tried to live as 
usual with the intention of being outdoors as much as possible''.   
During the pandemic, I have kept my physical and mental health. I am vaccinated, ''like 
every other good citizen [laughter]'', and I have not felt isolated. I think this is because I 
have several interests that I have been able to exercise even under pandemi c 
restrictions, namely: the church, ornithology, and seeing my previous teachers'' 
colleagues.    
First, it feels good to part of the church. For sure, we have had to do many changes 
during the pandemic. We were required to have fewer attendees in church services and 
to start with both online and outdoor services. We also had to change the Communion 
ceremony, to cancel the church choir rehearsals, and to cancel the weekly cafe visits with 
fellow pensioners. But still, I often joined the physical services in church since I volunteer 
 
 
      
 
as church host. Being part of the church, to me, feels ''satisfying and good in every way'', 
although I do not like some of the novelties, such as Zoom church services. Online 
services are a ''double -edged sword'' since you can be tempted to stay at home instead 
or going to the church. Even I have felt like: ''Oh, today it''s nice to turn on the compu ter 
and watch [the church service], especially afterwards on Facebook. This didn''t exist at all 
before the pandemic.''   
 
 
Second, my interest in ornithology has not been affected by the pandemic whatsoever. 
The ornithology community I belong to have made no restrictions at all, except for 
cancelled indoor meeting. But for me, this has made no difference because I only take 
part in outdoor activities.   
Third, I have continued seeing my former natural science teachers'' colleagues every 
week. Before the pandemic, we had lunch together at various restaurants in town, but 
we had to change the way we come together during the pandemic. It struck us that we 
could gather in grilling areas to grill hot dogs instead, and ''that has been fantastic '' I 
could never imagine that there were so many grilling areas in [City]!''. One interesting 
thing is that one of my former colleagues knows an infection control physician, who has 
been part of our gatherings. It has been a privilege to hear about his experience about 
infection control and the pandemic.   
Finally, what has been especially helpful for me during the pandemic is that I have had a 
lot of support from my children. They shopped for me before the vaccine came, which I 
appreciate a lot. However, once I had to admit to my children, ''with a blushed f ace'', that 
''I had been to [Retail Company, laughter]''. Also, I have socialised with many different 
groups of people. The communities I am engaged in '' the church, the ornithologists, 
and the groups of former teachers'' colleagues '' are very different from e ach other. I 
rarely see them in private: ''It''s not like I would invite ten ornithologists to have a beer in 
my home''. But I think it is ''fascinating '' to see different groups of people that have 
similar interests'' like me.","['Domestic', 'Workplace']",3,I am an 80 -year -old widowed
United States,"I am a 72 -year -old woman living with my husband in a small village in the 
countryside. Me and my husband have been married for 51 years. We have three grown-up children and eight grandchildren. We are committed members of a free church. I 
have a good, active life with many friends. My husband I have a great respect for the 
pandemic and follow the regulations, but we are not scared. Although life has been 
different during the pandemic, I do not feel isolated. This is probably due to the natu re 
around us. We live close to a lake and can move around rather freely in the surroundings. 
For example, we have had coffee with our friends in the garden on several occasio ns, 
we have had a birthday party on the ice, and during one period my children and their 
families lived in their boats in the harbour near us. In that sense, we are lucky. Also, since 
I am retired, I do not have to go to work. When I talk to my former coll eagues, I realise 
that being older might have made life easier during the pandemic. Generally, we have 
stayed healthy and have been able to live our life as we would like to live it.   
There is one thing that has been challenging for me during the pandemic. Me and my 
husband decided not to get vaccinated, and this choice has had severe consequences 
for us. ''People shouldn''t be marginalised because they don''t take the vaccine'', but I feel  
I have been treated very badly. The reactions towards my decision to not get vaccinated 
have, by far, been the worst aspect of the pandemic.    
Peoples'' reactions have differed. Some have been reserved. For example, our children 
expressed concerns over our decision, but I feel that they have respected our choice and 
that we get along well. Others have distanced themselves from us, partly or comple tely. 
I remember one situation when I took a walk with two ladies from the church. They asked 
me if I was vaccinated, and when I told them that I am not they took two, three steps 
back''. This backing off felt like they were stating ''you are dangerous. Since then, we 
have had almost no contact.'' Before the pandemic, we used to see other regularly. But 
suddenly, this just stopped.     
I have experienced not only that people have been reserved or distanced, but that they 
actually are scared of us. That is really hard to take. For example, we invited another 
couple to our home, and since they knew that we are not vaccinated, they underlin ed 
that we must be healthy when seeing them. To me, this is obvious. I would never invite 
someone to my house if I were ill. I have been thinking a lot about why people react like 
that:Do they care about us, or do they think that we have something that w e will spread 
to them? Are we the plague? Sometimes I feel like if we were the plague!'' In these 
situations, I am glad that my husband and I have each other.      
I would have wished for greater tolerance for my decision to not ''take the injection''. The 
social pressure for vaccination has been massive: from authorities, media, and 
acquaintances. ''It''s almost like a psychosis all over the country.'' I think the discus sion has 
been weird. Everyone must make their own choice. To me, vaccination is a matter of 
privacy and integrity. My husband and I ''have chosen another path and are willing to 
take the risks''.   
Also, I would have wished for a more open discussion on vaccination in church. 
Vaccination has been handled like a non -issue. On the one hand, I appreciate that the 
pro-vaccination campaigns have been missing in church. But on the other hand, since 
vacci nation has not been discussed at all, it has been possible for members of the church 
to behave disrespectfully. I feel that there is a double agenda in the church: one formal 
where vaccination is not discussed, and another informal where church members hav e 
questioned me as a person rather than my decision. ''I had whished for an open dialogue

village in the countryside, close to the forest and the lake. We both have grown -up 
children from previous marriages and many grandchildren. My children live close to me. 
My husband has  a medical condition and is not as mobile any longer, but I feel healthy 
and am psychically very active. We are both members of a free church and have a rich 
social life '' at least before the pandemic and in between the pandemic waves. I have 
stayed health y during the whole pandemic; I have not even had a cold.  
Before you came to my house, I looked through my diary for the last two years. I wanted 
to be prepared before talking to you and to reflect upon what I have done during the 
pandemic. Of course, I already knew that I had been outdoors a lot, but when readin g 
the diary this became even more obvious to me. It is like I moved my social life outdoors.   
I remember that I had many questions in the beginning of the pandemic. ''Shouldn't you 
be allowed to meet? '' Should we just sit at home and do nothing?'' I have many people 
that I care about as well as many interests: my children, my grandchildren, my home 
group, my sewing group, dancing classes, the second -hand store in church, and church 
services. It feels like many of these relations and interests were taken away from me when 
the pandemic struck.   
Luckily, I have been able to meet loved ones and to continue with many of my interests 
outdoors. In 2020, my husband celebrated his 80th birthday at the wooden deck outside 
our house with our home group from church, and my children took me to the hill near by 
when I turned 70. Later the same year, at the Lucia celebrations in December, my 
grandchildren sang for us standing at our driveway in the cold, and afterwards we had 
waffles in the garage keeping all the doors open. It was cold, but we could at least s ee 
each other. Also, we have had birthday parties for the grandchildren next to a wind 
shelter down by the lake. In all, ''this pandemic has probably been mostly about outdoor 
life'' for me. I think that has been the best way to maintain family life and othe r relations 
and activities. Being outdoors is something that I have always liked, so that part of the 
pandemic was not to complicated. But of course, I wished I could have said ''Welcome 
in!'' to people more often before we were vaccinated, but I felt that I  couldn''t.   
 
 
      
 
Being outdoors have helped me keeping up my mental health. At times, when I have felt 
low, my daily walks have been vital. I have always walked and hiked a lot, but during the 
pandemic I have taken even longer walks in the forest and along the water: between five 
and eight kilometres every day. I have walked irrespectively of season, I have  walked by 
myself, with my sister -in-law and with my ''take -a-walk gang''. These walks were, and still 
are, important for my recreation and for channelling the frustration about staying at 
home too much, just my husband and me.   
My husband and I have been very restrictive seeing people indoors, but we have made 
some exceptions. For example, we have seen three close relatives every now and then 
in each other''s homes. And at Christmas 2020, my husband''s daughter and her family 
were here. My husband and I sat in one end of the living -room, using medical visors, as 
far away from the others as we could. From now onwards, as society re -opens again after 
Omicron, I wish to avoid such awkward situations. Instead, I wish to do more of those

Sweden,"I am a 29 -year -old PhD student from a non -EU country and for the past three 
and a half years I have been living and working in a midsized town in Sweden. My 
contract was supposed to expire in August, but it has recently been extended by three 
months. This was really good news, but it does not solve my problems, it just postpones 
them.  
The pandemic affected my family situation and my work situation. I live on my own here 
in Sweden. My parents live abroad. Since the pandemic started, there is a non -EU 
entering ban to Sweden, so my parents have not been able to visit me. I did get to go to  
see them eventually, which was nice, but I find it very strange that I have been here over 
three years and my parents have not been able to visit. ''It creates a sense of insecurity I 
would say. Because you want to know that if something out of the ordinar y happens, 
your parents can come and help you, but they can't come and that's not nice''.   
In terms of work, I am quite upset that my PhD coincided with the pandemic. I always 
imagined my PhD years would be a time for travelling, visiting institutions, going to 
conferences and meeting new people. Instead, my mobility has been very limited. Also,  
in the past six months, I have really started to miss having colleagues. ''It is really lonely 
 
 
      
 
to be a PhD student right now''. I used to quite like working from home. Now, I don''t see 
the point going in to work as no one is there. I miss going to lunch with colleagues, ''these 
routines that exist that you can join whenever you like''. There is little emotional support, 
''but I also feel very under -stimulated intellectually, like I am not g etting any new ideas or 
new and interesting interactions with anyone''. In the first year of the pandemic, I thought 
it was cool that I could join a seminar in differen t country using zoom, but now, I really 
don''t like zoom. ''I want actual in person interaction''.  
The pandemic also heavily affected my data collection. It was delayed by eight months, 
and in the end the university gave me a three -month extension. I will not be able to finish 
my PhD on time and there is a second aspect that makes this much worse. Last summer 
they changed the law for getting permanent residence in Sweden. Before this change, 
four years of employment as a PhD student entitled you to permanent residence. Now, 
you need a work contract guaranteeing employment for at least 18 months after you r 
PhD. This is not how academia works, no one gets an 18 -month contract straight after 
finishing a PhD.   
All my plans were based on getting residence in Sweden. It would have provided a sense 
of security to know that I could stay; or move somewhere else if I wanted to. I have a life 
here now. I have my friends here, my apartment, my work. I have a partner. I have learnt 
the language. ''And my ties to my home country have weakened during this time. Which 
is quite normal, I find''. I am looking at other options, but my worst -case scenario is that I 
have to leave, finish my thesis at my parents'' house and come back  on a tourist visa for 
the defence.  
Neither the university, my department nor my PhD programme, have handled the 
situation well. Generally speaking, they are good at attracting international talent, but 
very bad at keeping it. My initial request for an extension was denied and I had to give a 
very detailed description of exactly how my data collection was postponed to eventually 
get three months. Also, they did not send the decision directly to me but to my 
supervisors. I found the whole process very demeaning. Especially when you hear of 
other, better funded departments, where all PhD students got an extension without even 
applying for one.   
The whole experience has made me think about Sweden differently. ''I feel more 
hopeless for the future. I think Sweden is going to a very bad direction politically''. Racism 
and discrimination are bound to increase in the next few years, and I''m not sure I w ant 
to be here for that. I used to think of Sweden as an exception, that at least they were 
trying to be more inclusive but now, it is like they are not even trying, ''they are actually 
reversing the good things that they did''.   
In the beginning, there were some petitions and manifestations and I had hopes that we 
could reverse the law somehow. Now, I''m less hopeful. ''For the first time in my life, I feel 
like I lost my agency and that's a horrible feeling''. I''ve experienced econo mic insecurity 
before, with short term employment and so on, ''but this feels like a direct intervention in 
my life'' someone is telling me I cannot live here anymore''. I come from quite a 
privileged, middle -class background and I always thought I was free t o make my own 
decisions. That all changed with the new law and although ''I know how it is out there for 
many people, I just didn't realise that I was so close to that myself''.

United States,"I am a 34 -year -old PhD student from a non -EU country currently living in a 
midsized town in Sweden. If all goes to plan, I will defend my thesis this autumn. If it goes 
according to one of the plans, I should say as ''all of my plans now are mental plans th at 
depend entirely on the mercy of the Migration Agency''. My funding runs out in July, and 
I could cover the months until my defence using my savings, if only I know that I could 
stay after I graduate.   
As a consequence of the new migration law introduced in 2021, international PhD 
students are no longer entitled to permanent residence after they complete their 
 
studies. I found out about this change when ''I was just scrolling through the Migration 
Agency website. I like to stay updated with the latest crazy stuff that they have on the 
website, and I couldn''t believe my eyes when I when read about the changes''.  
I left my home country looking for new challenges and before I came to Sweden, I lived 
in another Nordic country for nearly four years, working and studying. ''I left that Nordic 
country for Sweden partly because I got this PhD position but also because aft er four 
years, I could get permanent residence. I was looking for a home. The other Nordic 
country was not a happy place for me, I did not like living there. So I thought, OK, I''ll 
move here to do my PhD, I am passionate about the topic, and I have worked very hard 
for this. And after four years, I don''t have to worry about visas anymore. I will have finally 
found a home. Being a homosexual from [home country] who was looking for fresh and 
free air to breathe, I thought Sweden would be that place. But that is not the case''.  
The effect of the pandemic on me was not so bad in the sense that it did not affect my 
work too much. Well, it did in the sense that I had planned to collect data in my home 
country, and I had to change my plans and do an online data collection instead. Th is 
meant redesigning my study and reapplying to the ethical review board in my home 
country. So I lost maybe six months doing that. However, while I was waiting for a 
decision, I got access to Finish data that I wrote an article on. So in the end, I didn''t  waste 
too much time. However, the pandemic did mean ''I was just sitting at home working. 
Work never left my head at all so I was always regurgitating things''. ''As soon as things 
started easing up, I went back to work because it was too much''. So academica lly 
speaking, I was able to use my time wisely and be smart about the situation, ''with the 
help of my supervisor, who was brilliant'', but socially it affected me a lot. I was having 
lunches on my own at home as my boyfriend works in a hospital. And then wh en I went 
back to work, I was still having lunches on my own. Whereas pre -Covid, I would have had 
lunch with my colleagues every day.   
''But I have to tell you that I wouldn't have been able to continue working since the 
summer had I not started taking pills. I'm on SSRI right now and I cannot stop taking them 
before I finish the PhD because I will probably lose my head''. Nobody can work i n this 
situation, to go to work every day and be more productive than most members of the 
department in order to finish a PhD on time. All under the threat of deportation. ''It is not 
humane.''   
My department has not been supportive. From the very start it has been a ''non -friendly'' 
environment for international PhD students. Although it was never stated as a 
requirement for this position that I had to learn the language, all meetings and all 
corre spondence is in Swedish. I filed a discrimination complaint about this and ''the 
Swedes got together in one of the staff meetings and discussed the issue from their 
perspective''. They took the decision that the meetings should continue to be held in 
Swedish , excluding us completely.   
The response of the university to the change in the migration law was underwhelming to 
say the least. Other universities took part in the public debate and expressed concern, 
but not this one. They seemed largely unconcerned. This is not a proper internati onal 
university. Some individual researchers have an international outlook, but the 
administration is lagging way behind ''and unfortunately the power is with the 
administration, not with the academic people''.   
 
 
 
Before we finish, I want to say that not everything has been bad. ''The PhD atmosphere 
has been brilliant. There is a group of around ten PhD students that I am very tight with. 
They are very socially aware, critically aware, and respectful to each other. And there are 
some professors in our department that I think are commendable and inspir ing.'' Finally, 
I have to say to I am glad I was in Sweden during the pandemic. ''The Swedish response, 
some people have a lot of reservations about it, but I really apprec iated it''.  '''",['Education'],0,"I was waiting for a decision, I"
Sweden,"I am a 26 -year -old woman from Syria, and I came to Sweden less than two 
years ago. My parents and younger siblings came to Sweden six years ago but because 
I was over eighteen when they left, I had to stay by myself in Syria. I went to university 
there and  I have a degree in architecture. I am hoping to go to university here and get a 
master''s degree in architecture as that is what I want to work with eventually.   
I managed to get a visa to another Schengen -area country which meant I could enter 
Sweden without problems, but it also meant I had to wait six months before I could apply 
for asylum. If I had done it earlier, they would have sent me back to this country i nstead. 
The wait was horrible, and I really did not like being in Sweden at the time. The worst 
part was not being allowed to work or study. I was just sitting at home all the time, bored 
and sad. The fact that I arrived just as the pandemic started didn''t  help, of course, as 
everything was closed. There were no language cafes or any of those places where you 
can meet Swedish people. To learn the language, you need to meet people and speak 
to them. It is not enough to only read and listen.   
At first, I lived with my family. I did enjoy spending time with them again. We had a lot of 
fun. And they also helped me with the language. My mother had saved her study 
material from when she studied Swedish so I started looking at this and I quickly got  the 
hang of it. I found it quite similar to English. We tried to speak only Swedish at home. If I 
had any difficulties when I studied on my own, they could explain it to me. So they helped 
a lot.  
 
 
 
 
Then I started attending classes with an adult education association that teaches 
Swedish to asylum seekers. The classes were all online because of the pandemic. It 
would have been better if they had been in a classroom, I think it is always better to learn 
a language when you actually meet people, but it was still good. I met a teacher  there 
that helped me improve my language so much. He taught me everything about grammar 
and he helped me prepare for the SFI (Swedish for immigrants) test.   
Most new immigrants spend a few years at SFI after they receive a residence permit, 
learning basic Swedish. I skipped this step completely. Because of the help I got from 
the association and this teacher, I didn''t need to go to SFI at all. I am currently s tudying 
Swedish at secondary school level, as well as basic level English.   
Another big change during this time was that I met my husband. After we got married, 
we moved to a different town in Sweden. I am living with him now. Apart from studying, 
I am also working extra as a substitute in preschools and schools. Some of my classe s 
are still online, not because of the pandemic but because of a shortage of teachers, and 
it actually suits me now. It is much easier for me to combine work with online classes. If I 
had to go to school, it would be much more difficult. Life is good now t hat I get to work 
and study. I like living in Sweden now.","['Education', 'Domestic']",0,I am hoping to go to university
